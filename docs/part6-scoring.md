# Part VI: Scoring Methodologies and Psychometric Foundations

Mathematical and statistical foundations underlying SHL assessments, from Classical Test Theory to modern IRT applications.

## Chapters in This Part

| Chapter | Title | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 24 | CTT vs IRT | Fundamental approaches, when each is appropriate |
| 25 | IRT Scoring Deep Dive | Theta estimation, 1PL/2PL/3PL models |
| 26 | Normative Data Strategies | Sten scores, norm groups, job level stratification |
| 27 | Validity and Reliability | Criterion validity, construct validity, reliability evidence |
| 28 | Competency Prediction Algorithms | Weighted formulas, DNV Logic, P+A integration |

## Learning Goals

By completing Part VI, you will:
- Distinguish between CTT and IRT scoring methodologies
- Interpret theta scores, sten scores, and percentile ranks
- Select appropriate norm groups for different assessment contexts
- Apply the competency prediction formula with DNV moderation logic
