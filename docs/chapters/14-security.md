## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. Understand the challenge of unsupervised online testing
2. Recognize the two-stage verification model (VAT and VVT)
3. Grasp the Confidence Indicator algorithm for detecting score discrepancies
4. Appreciate security measures against cheating and test compromise
5. Explain proctoring options and their trade-offs
6. Describe item security and exposure management strategies

## The Challenge of Unsupervised Testing

**Note:** Detailed content for this chapter should be sourced from comprehensive SHL documentation. This chapter covers:

- Unsupervised vs. supervised testing contexts
- Verification tests (VAT - Verify Ability Test, VVT - Verify Verification Test)
- Confidence Indicators for score discrepancies
- Item security and exposure management
- Proctoring options (remote, in-person)
- Cheating detection and prevention
- Legal and ethical considerations

## Two-Stage Verification Model

### Verify Ability Test (VAT)
[Content to be added: Unsupervised online administration, initial ability estimate]

### Verify Verification Test (VVT)
[Content to be added: Supervised follow-up, score confirmation]

---

## Confidence Indicators

[Content to be added: Algorithm for detecting suspicious score discrepancies, interpretation]

---

## Item Security Strategies

[Content to be added: Item exposure limits, banking strategies, content protection]

---

## Proctoring Options

[Content to be added: In-person proctoring, remote proctoring technology, trade-offs]

---

## Cheating Detection and Prevention

[Content to be added: Red flags, statistical methods, policy frameworks]

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Verification Model:** Two-stage approach balances convenience with security
2. **Confidence Indicators:** Statistical algorithms flag suspicious score discrepancies
3. **Item Security:** Exposure control and banking strategies protect test integrity
4. **Proctoring Options:** Range from unsupervised to fully proctored administration
5. **Detection Methods:** Multiple approaches identify potential cheating or coaching
6. **Legal Frameworks:** Verification protocols support defensibility of hiring decisions
