# Tier 3 - The 112 Components

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. Explain the purpose of Tier 3's granular behavioral components
2. Understand the 96 vs. 112 component count discrepancy
3. Describe how behavioral indicators define components
4. Explain the five job complexity levels
5. Understand how Tier 3 enables client-specific competency mapping
6. Recognize Tier 3's role in assessment innovation
7. Evaluate when Tier 3 detail is necessary versus when Tier 2 suffices

### The Atomic Level: Maximum Granularity

Tier 3 of the Universal Competency Framework represents the most granular, detailed level of the competency hierarchy—what might be called the "molecular structure" or "atomic level" of workplace behavior. This tier contains **96 to 112 specific behavioral components** depending on documentation version and application.

Unlike Tier 1 (Great Eight) and Tier 2 (20 Dimensions), which feature prominently in most candidate reports, Tier 3 typically operates in the background—providing the detailed behavioral foundation upon which the broader tiers are built, but not usually presented directly to end-users.

### The 96 vs. 112 Component Count: Clarifying the Discrepancy

SHL documentation sometimes references **96 components**, other times **112 components**. This apparent inconsistency reflects the framework's evolution and different application contexts:

**96 Components**: The simplified, publicly documented version used in most client-facing materials and general competency modeling. This version provides sufficient granularity for most organizational applications while remaining manageable.

**112 Components**: The complete technical model used for full UCF mapping and complex client-specific competency frameworks. This version includes additional behavioral components that allow for more precise mapping of unique organizational language and requirements.

The difference represents a trade-off between comprehensiveness and usability:
- **96-component version**: Optimal for standard applications, faster to implement, easier to validate
- **112-component version**: Maximum flexibility for bespoke applications, captures additional behavioral nuances, supports complex organizational taxonomies

Both versions maintain the same hierarchical structure—the 112-component version simply provides additional behavioral specificity within certain dimensions.

### What Are Behavioral Components?

Each Tier 3 component is defined as a **specific, observable workplace behavior** rather than a broad competency or abstract trait. Components are expressed as concrete actions that can be observed, rated, and developed.

**Example components under "Analyzing" (Dimension 4.3):**
- "Breaks down complex problems into component parts"
- "Identifies patterns in numerical data"
- "Draws logical conclusions from available information"
- "Distinguishes relevant from irrelevant information"
- "Questions assumptions underlying proposed solutions"
- "Integrates information from multiple sources"

**Example components under "Leading and Supervising" (Dimension 1.2):**
- "Provides clear direction to team members"
- "Delegates tasks appropriately based on capabilities"
- "Monitors team performance against objectives"
- "Addresses performance issues promptly and constructively"
- "Makes final decisions when team cannot reach consensus"
- "Takes responsibility for team outcomes"

Notice that each component:
1. **Describes a specific behavior** rather than a general capability
2. **Is observable** by others (supervisors, peers, subordinates)
3. **Can be rated** on a frequency or effectiveness scale
4. **Suggests development actions** (the behavior itself suggests what to practice or improve)
5. **Connects to assessment predictors** (specific OPQ traits or abilities predict each component)

### Behavioral Indicators: Positive and Negative

Each Tier 3 component is further defined with **positive and negative behavioral indicators**—specific examples of what the behavior looks like when performed effectively versus ineffectively.

**Example: "Provides clear direction to team members" (component under Leading and Supervising)**

*Positive Indicators (Effective)*:
- Explains what needs to be accomplished and why
- Specifies quality standards and deadlines clearly
- Ensures team members understand their individual responsibilities
- Checks understanding before assuming clarity
- Provides written confirmation of key directions

*Negative Indicators (Ineffective)*:
- Gives vague instructions that leave room for misinterpretation
- Assumes others know what is expected without explicit communication
- Changes direction frequently without explanation
- Fails to specify success criteria or timelines
- Blames team for not understanding unclear directions

This behavioral indicator structure serves multiple purposes:

**Assessment**: Provides specific behaviors for raters to observe in assessment centers, structured interviews, or performance evaluations

**Feedback**: Offers concrete examples for developmental feedback—rather than "You need to improve leadership," feedback becomes "You need to provide clearer direction, specifically by stating deadlines explicitly and checking understanding"

**Training**: Suggests specific skills to develop in training programs

**Validation**: Enables precise criterion measurement for validity studies

### The Five Job Complexity Levels

One of Tier 3's most sophisticated features is that behavioral components are **calibrated across five levels of job complexity**. The same competency component manifests differently at different organizational levels:

**Level 1: Entry/Support Level**
- Follows established procedures
- Works under close supervision
- Handles routine tasks
- Example: "Follows standard troubleshooting procedures to resolve common technical issues"

**Level 2: Operational/Individual Contributor Level**
- Works with moderate independence
- Solves problems within defined parameters
- Adapts standard approaches to specific situations
- Example: "Adapts troubleshooting approach when standard procedures don't resolve issues"

**Level 3: Professional/Team Lead Level**
- Works with considerable autonomy
- Solves complex, non-routine problems
- May guide or influence others
- Example: "Develops new troubleshooting protocols for emerging technical issues"

**Level 4: Management/Specialist Level**
- Manages others or deep technical expertise
- Makes decisions with significant impact
- Creates systems and processes
- Example: "Designs comprehensive diagnostic systems that enable efficient troubleshooting across the organization"

**Level 5: Executive/Strategic Level**
- Sets organizational direction
- Makes strategic decisions with enterprise-wide impact
- Shapes organizational systems and culture
- Example: "Establishes organizational philosophy regarding technical support quality and rapid issue resolution"

This complexity calibration ensures that competency assessment and development are appropriate to organizational level. An entry-level candidate doesn't need to demonstrate Level 5 strategic thinking, while an executive candidate must.

The complexity levels also enable **career progression modeling**—identifying what behavioral development is needed as individuals advance through organizational levels.

### Purpose and Application of Tier 3

While Tier 3 components rarely appear directly in standard candidate reports, they serve critical functions:

#### 1. Client-Specific Competency Mapping

Organizations often have unique competency frameworks using their own terminology and behavioral definitions. Tier 3 enables **precise mapping** between client-specific competency models and the standard UCF backbone.

**Process**:
1. Client provides their competency model (e.g., "Strategic Vision," "Customer Centricity," "Operational Excellence")
2. SHL consultants analyze each client competency's behavioral components
3. Consultants map client behavioral components to corresponding UCF Tier 3 components
4. Regression equations link OPQ traits and Verify scores to client competencies via the Tier 3 mapping

**Advantage**: The client gets reports using their own competency language, but the underlying psychometric validity is maintained through the UCF backbone. Organizations don't need to conduct extensive local validation—they inherit the UCF's established validity evidence.

**Example**: A pharmaceutical company's competency "Scientific Excellence" might map to UCF components including:
- "Applies technical expertise to solve complex problems" (from Applying Expertise and Technology)
- "Critically evaluates scientific evidence" (from Analyzing)
- "Stays current with scientific developments" (from Learning and Researching)
- "Generates innovative research approaches" (from Creating and Innovating)

#### 2. Validation Research Foundation

Tier 3 components provide the **criterion variables** for validating the UCF's predictive accuracy. Validation studies typically:
1. Have supervisors rate employees on specific Tier 3 behavioral components
2. Correlate these ratings with employees' OPQ trait scores and Verify ability scores
3. Determine which traits/abilities predict which components
4. Build regression equations for Tier 2 dimension predictions based on component-level correlations

The granularity of Tier 3 enables more precise validation than relying only on broad competency ratings.

#### 3. Development Planning Detail

When standard Tier 2 competency feedback indicates a development need, Tier 3 provides the **specific behavioral targets** for improvement.

**Example**: If a report indicates low potential in "Leading and Supervising" (Tier 2), Tier 3 specifies which aspects need development:
- ✓ Strength: "Makes decisions for the team when needed"
- ✗ Development need: "Provides clear direction and expectations"
- ✗ Development need: "Addresses performance issues promptly"
- ✓ Strength: "Takes responsibility for team outcomes"

This specificity enables more targeted development interventions—in this case, communication and difficult conversations training rather than generic leadership development.

#### 4. Assessment Center Design

Assessment centers and structured interviews can be designed to elicit specific Tier 3 behavioral components through targeted exercises.

**Example**: To assess "Analyzing" competency components, exercises might include:
- Case study requiring "Breaking down complex problems into component parts"
- Data interpretation task assessing "Identifying patterns in numerical data"
- Group discussion evaluating "Questioning assumptions underlying proposed solutions"

The behavioral specificity of Tier 3 ensures assessment methods actually measure the intended competencies.

#### 5. 360-Degree Feedback Instruments

SHL's 360-degree feedback tools are built on Tier 3 behavioral components, with raters assessing specific observable behaviors rather than abstract competencies.

**Advantage**: Behavioral specificity improves:
- **Rating accuracy**: Easier to rate "Provides clear direction to team members" than abstract "Leadership"
- **Feedback actionability**: Specific behaviors clearly indicate what to improve
- **Rater agreement**: Reduces variability in how different raters interpret competencies

### Innovation: Rapid Assessment of 96 Components

One of SHL's recent innovations is the **Universal Competency Assessment**—a tool that measures all 96 components of the UCF in just 15 minutes.

This represents a significant technological achievement:
- **Traditional approach**: Assessing 96 behavioral components through 360-degree feedback or assessment centers might require hours or days
- **Innovation**: Advanced adaptive algorithms and efficient item design enable comprehensive assessment in 15 minutes

The rapid assessment tool serves specific applications:
- **Development planning**: Quickly identifying specific behavioral strengths and development needs
- **Team composition analysis**: Rapidly profiling entire teams to identify collective strengths and gaps
- **Talent analytics**: Enabling large-scale competency profiling across organizations

This innovation demonstrates Tier 3's ongoing relevance—while the behavioral components were designed for detailed mapping and validation, technological advances now enable direct measurement of this atomic level.

### When Tier 3 Detail Is Necessary

Most organizational applications operate effectively at Tier 2 (20 dimensions), so when is Tier 3 necessary?

**Tier 3 is essential when:**

1. **Client has unique competency framework**: Precise mapping to client terminology requires Tier 3 granularity

2. **Highly specialized roles**: Roles with unique behavioral requirements (e.g., air traffic control, surgical nursing) may require specific component-level assessment

3. **Development planning focus**: When assessment is primarily for development rather than selection, Tier 3 provides actionable behavioral targets

4. **Research and validation**: Any validation study or research project requires Tier 3 criterion measurement

5. **Assessment center design**: Creating exercises to elicit specific behaviors requires component-level specification

6. **360-degree feedback**: Behavioral specificity improves rating quality and feedback utility

7. **Succession planning**: Identifying specific developmental experiences for high-potential employees benefits from component-level analysis

**Tier 2 suffices when:**

1. **Standard selection**: Most hiring decisions can be made effectively using Tier 2 dimension scores

2. **Executive summary**: Senior leaders need Tier 1 (Great Eight) or Tier 2 overview, not Tier 3 detail

3. **High-volume recruitment**: Processing large candidate volumes requires efficiency—Tier 2 provides sufficient granularity

4. **Standard roles**: Common positions (sales, customer service, management) are well-served by standard Tier 2 profiles

### The Hierarchical Integration: How Tiers Connect

Understanding how Tier 3 relates to Tier 2 and Tier 1 clarifies the framework's power:

**Bottom-Up (Building Blocks)**:
- Multiple **Tier 3 behavioral components** aggregate to form each **Tier 2 competency dimension**
- Multiple **Tier 2 dimensions** cluster logically under each **Tier 1 Great Eight factor**

**Top-Down (Elaboration)**:
- Each **Tier 1 Great Eight factor** elaborates into multiple **Tier 2 dimensions**
- Each **Tier 2 dimension** elaborates into multiple **Tier 3 behavioral components**

**Example: Leading and Deciding (Tier 1)**
↓
Breaks down into three Tier 2 dimensions:
- 1.1 Deciding and Initiating Action
- 1.2 Leading and Supervising
- 1.3 Entrepreneurial and Commercial Thinking
↓
Each dimension breaks down into Tier 3 components:

**Dimension 1.2: Leading and Supervising** includes components:
- Provides clear direction to team members
- Delegates tasks appropriately
- Monitors team performance
- Addresses performance issues
- Makes decisions for the team
- Takes responsibility for team outcomes
- Develops team members' capabilities
- Builds team cohesion and morale
[and 4-8 additional components depending on 96 vs. 112 version]

This hierarchical structure enables:
- **Drill-down analysis**: Start with Tier 1 overview, drill down to Tier 2 specifics, and when needed, examine Tier 3 behavioral detail
- **Roll-up reporting**: Aggregate Tier 3 behavioral ratings up to Tier 2 dimension scores, then up to Tier 1 factor scores
- **Flexible application**: Use the appropriate level of detail for each purpose

### The Technical Mapping Process

When consultants map client competencies to the UCF using Tier 3:

**Step 1: Behavioral Decomposition**
- Break client competency definitions into specific behavioral components
- List all behaviors the client includes under each competency label

**Step 2: UCF Component Matching**
- Match each client behavioral component to the most similar UCF Tier 3 component
- Identify multiple UCF components if the client behavior is complex

**Step 3: Dimension Weighting**
- Determine which UCF Tier 2 dimensions contribute to each client competency
- Assign relative weights based on how many Tier 3 components from each dimension match

**Step 4: Predictor Identification**
- Identify which OPQ traits and Verify abilities predict the relevant UCF components
- Inherit the validated regression weights from the UCF research

**Step 5: Algorithm Configuration**
- Configure the scoring algorithm to calculate client competency predictions
- Generate reports using client terminology while maintaining UCF validity

This process preserves psychometric rigor while accommodating organizational uniqueness.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Atomic Level**: Tier 3 comprises 96-112 specific behavioral components representing the most granular level of the UCF hierarchy.

2. **96 vs. 112**: The component count varies by application—96 for standard use, 112 for maximum flexibility in complex mapping.

3. **Behavioral Specificity**: Components are concrete, observable behaviors (e.g., "Breaks down complex problems") rather than abstract competencies.

4. **Behavioral Indicators**: Each component is defined with positive (effective) and negative (ineffective) behavioral examples for assessment and feedback.

5. **Complexity Levels**: Components are calibrated across five job complexity levels (entry to executive), ensuring level-appropriate assessment.

6. **Client Mapping Function**: Tier 3's primary function is enabling precise mapping of client-specific competency frameworks to the validated UCF backbone.

7. **Validation Foundation**: Tier 3 components serve as criterion variables in validation research, providing precise behavioral targets for correlating with OPQ/Verify scores.

8. **Development Targeting**: When development needs are identified at Tier 2, Tier 3 provides specific behavioral targets for improvement.

9. **Innovation Platform**: Recent innovations like the 15-minute Universal Competency Assessment demonstrate direct measurement of all 96 components.

10. **Appropriate Application**: Tier 3 is essential for client mapping, development planning, and research but unnecessary for standard selection or executive summaries.

11. **Hierarchical Integration**: Tier 3 components aggregate into Tier 2 dimensions, which cluster under Tier 1 factors, enabling flexible drill-down and roll-up analysis.

12. **Background Operation**: Unlike Tiers 1 and 2 which appear in most reports, Tier 3 typically operates in the background, providing the behavioral foundation for visible competency predictions.
