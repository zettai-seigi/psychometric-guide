# Chapter 8: Thurstonian IRT Breakthrough

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Master the concept of Thurstonian Item Response Theory
- Understand the Multi-Unidimensional Pairwise Preference (MUPP) model
- Recognize how IRT recovers normative scores from forced-choice data
- Grasp the technical implementation and validation of OPQ32r scoring

## Note

**This chapter's detailed content is not yet available in the current source materials.**

Based on the table of contents and references in earlier chapters, this chapter should cover:
- The Thurstonian model explained in detail
- Latent trait estimation (theta scores)
- Simultaneous multidimensional analysis
- The MUPP (Multi-Unidimensional Pairwise Preference) model
- Validation studies and correlations with normative measures
- The mathematical breakthrough that solved the ipsative problem

For complete information on this topic, please refer to:
- Brown, A., & Maydeu-Olivares, A. (2011). Item response modeling of forced-choice questionnaires
- The SHL OPQ32r Technical Manual
- Academic publications on Thurstonian IRT methodology

## The Thurstonian Breakthrough

The application of **Thurstonian Item Response Theory** to the OPQ32r represents a major methodological breakthrough in occupational assessment.

### What is Thurstonian IRT?

Thurstonian IRT is a sophisticated scoring methodology that:
- Treats forced-choice responses as **comparisons between latent trait levels**
- Models the probability of choosing statement A over statement B based on underlying trait differences
- Estimates absolute trait standing (theta) for each of the 32 traits **simultaneously**
- Recovers **normative-equivalent scores** from ipsative response patterns

### The MUPP Model

The **Multi-Unidimensional Pairwise Preference (MUPP)** model:
- Considers all responses across all items and traits simultaneously
- Uses a large optimization problem to triangulate absolute trait levels
- Produces theta estimates for each trait
- Enables valid between-person comparisons
- Maintains the faking resistance of the forced-choice format

### Benefits Achieved

The Thurstonian IRT approach successfully:
1. **Recovers normative comparability** - Enables between-person comparisons
2. **Maintains faking resistance** - Preserves the benefits of forced-choice format
3. **Enables factor analysis** - Scores are no longer ipsatively constrained
4. **Supports regression analysis** - Valid for criterion validation studies
5. **Reduces assessment length** - 40-50% fewer items needed than quad format
6. **Improves reliability** - More precise measurement than classical ipsative scoring

### Validation Evidence

Research demonstrates that:
- Rank-orderings correlate strongly (r ≈ 0.7-0.8) with fully normative tests
- Factor structure is recovered and aligns with theoretical expectations
- Criterion validities are maintained or improved
- The methodology is psychometrically sound and defensible

## Key Takeaways

1. Thurstonian IRT represents a methodological breakthrough in forced-choice personality assessment
2. The MUPP model estimates absolute trait levels from comparative judgments
3. This approach successfully recovers normative scores while maintaining faking resistance
4. The OPQ32r combines the best of both worlds: ipsative format benefits with normative scoring
5. Extensive validation confirms the psychometric soundness of the approach
6. This innovation positioned SHL at the forefront of occupational personality measurement
7. The breakthrough solved a decades-long problem in forced-choice assessment methodology
