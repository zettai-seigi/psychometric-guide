## Theoretical Grounding and Purpose

The SHL Motivation Questionnaire (MQ) is firmly **grounded in theories of motivation and values in the workplace**. This theoretical grounding defines the structure, content, and purpose of the assessment within SHL's broader assessment framework. Unlike personality assessments that measure behavioral style or ability tests that measure cognitive capacity, the MQ addresses a fundamentally different question: **What energizes or deflates an individual's work motivation?**

The MQ's framework draws from **content theories of motivation**, which focus on identifying specific needs or values that drive human behavior. These theories posit that individuals have stable preference patterns regarding workplace conditions—for example, the desire for achievement, the need for job security, or the preference for autonomy. By assessing how various workplace situations affect a person's enthusiasm, the MQ taps into stable preference patterns akin to a **work values inventory**.

### Primary Purpose and Applications

The MQ offers a comprehensive profile of **what motivates or demotivates** an individual at work. Its primary purposes include:

- **Predicting Fit:** By assessing motivational factors, the MQ allows employers to match individual motivators with specific job roles or organizational cultures, linking motivation to potential engagement and performance outcomes
- **Development Focus:** The MQ is often used in coaching or development contexts where strict norming is less emphasized, as its output yields a **detailed motivational fingerprint**
- **Engagement Prediction:** High scores on motivators present in a role predict engagement and retention, while misalignment between strong demotivators and job features signals a disengagement risk

## McClelland's Achievement/Power/Affiliation Needs

David McClelland's needs theory represents one of the foundational frameworks explicitly incorporated into the MQ's theoretical structure. McClelland proposed that individuals are motivated by three core psychological needs that manifest differently across people:

### Achievement (nAch)

The **Need for Achievement** reflects an individual's desire to overcome challenges, accomplish difficult tasks, and meet high standards of excellence. People high in achievement motivation:

- Seek out challenging but attainable goals
- Prefer situations where they can take personal responsibility for outcomes
- Value feedback on their performance
- Are driven by the intrinsic satisfaction of accomplishment rather than external rewards

**MQ Connection:** The MQ directly measures Achievement as one of its 18 dimensions within the Energy & Dynamism domain. This dimension captures the need to overcome challenges and set ambitious goals. Additionally, the Competition dimension (drive to outperform others) and Fear of Failure dimension (concern about not meeting standards) relate to achievement-oriented motivation.

### Power (nPow)

The **Need for Power** reflects an individual's desire to influence, lead, and have an impact on others. This need manifests as:

- Desire to control one's work environment and influence others
- Preference for positions of authority and leadership
- Motivation to make an impact and leave a legacy
- Interest in gaining recognition and status

McClelland distinguished between **socialized power** (using influence for organizational benefit) and **personalized power** (using influence for personal gain).

**MQ Connection:** The MQ measures Power as a distinct dimension, specifically capturing the need for authority and influence. Related dimensions include Status (outward signs of seniority) and Progression (career advancement), which often accompany power-seeking motivation.

### Affiliation (nAff)

The **Need for Affiliation** reflects an individual's desire for friendly, close interpersonal relationships and social acceptance. People high in affiliation motivation:

- Prefer cooperative rather than competitive situations
- Value being part of a team or group
- Seek approval and reassurance from others
- Are motivated by social harmony and belonging

**MQ Connection:** The MQ directly measures Affiliation as one of its dimensions within the Synergy domain, specifically capturing the desire for teamwork and helping others. The Recognition dimension (need for acknowledgment) is also related, as it reflects the social validation aspect of affiliation needs.

### Theoretical Integration

McClelland's framework is particularly valuable for the MQ because it recognizes that:

1. **Individual differences are stable:** People have relatively consistent motivational profiles over time
2. **Needs can be measured:** These psychological needs can be assessed through self-report and situational preferences
3. **Context matters:** The same individual may be more or less motivated depending on whether the environment satisfies their dominant needs
4. **Implications for fit:** Understanding someone's need profile allows prediction of which roles, tasks, and organizational cultures will energize versus deplete them

The MQ extends McClelland's framework by measuring these three core needs alongside 15 additional workplace motivators, providing a more comprehensive profile of workplace drivers.

## Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory

Frederick Herzberg's **Two-Factor Theory** (also called the Motivation-Hygiene Theory) provides another critical theoretical foundation for the MQ. Herzberg distinguished between two categories of workplace factors:

### Hygiene Factors (Dissatisfiers)

**Hygiene factors** are workplace conditions that, when absent or inadequate, cause dissatisfaction and demotivation. However, their presence does not necessarily motivate—they simply prevent dissatisfaction. Hygiene factors include:

- **Job security:** Protection from layoffs and employment stability
- **Working conditions:** Physical environment, safety, and comfort
- **Compensation:** Adequate and fair pay
- **Company policies:** Clear, fair, and reasonable rules
- **Interpersonal relations:** Quality of relationships with supervisors and peers
- **Work-life balance:** Reasonable hours and workload

According to Herzberg, these factors are **extrinsic** to the work itself—they relate to the context in which work is performed rather than the work content.

### Motivators (Satisfiers)

**Motivators** are factors that, when present, create satisfaction and drive performance. These factors are **intrinsic** to the work itself and include:

- **Achievement:** Completing challenging work and meeting goals
- **Recognition:** Acknowledgment and appreciation for accomplishments
- **The work itself:** Interesting, meaningful, and varied tasks
- **Responsibility:** Autonomy and ownership over one's work
- **Advancement:** Opportunities for promotion and growth
- **Personal growth:** Development of new skills and competencies

Herzberg argued that true motivation comes from these intrinsic factors, while hygiene factors merely establish a baseline—their absence demotivates, but their presence doesn't strongly motivate.

### MQ Connection to Two-Factor Theory

The MQ's organizational structure reflects Herzberg's distinction through its four domain groupings:

**Extrinsic Domain (Hygiene-related):**
- **Material Reward:** Salary and bonus linkage (hygiene factor)
- **Progression:** Career advancement (motivator, but external reward)
- **Status:** Position and respect (external recognition)

**Intrinsic Domain (Motivator-related):**
- **Interest:** Stimulating, varied work (work itself)
- **Autonomy:** Independence and responsibility
- **Flexibility:** Tolerance for ambiguity (relates to work design)

**Synergy Domain (Mixed):**
- **Recognition:** Acknowledgment (motivator)
- **Personal Growth:** Development opportunities (motivator)
- **Ease and Security:** Job security (hygiene factor)
- **Affiliation:** Teamwork (interpersonal relations)
- **Personal Principles:** Ethical alignment (relates to company policies)

**Energy & Dynamism Domain (Motivator-oriented):**
- **Achievement:** Overcoming challenges (motivator)
- **Power:** Authority and influence (motivator)
- **Competition:** Drive to outperform (motivator)

### Theoretical Insights Applied

Herzberg's framework informs several key aspects of MQ interpretation:

1. **Profile interpretation:** Low scores on extrinsic factors may indicate potential dissatisfaction risks (hygiene deficits), while high scores on intrinsic factors suggest what will truly energize performance

2. **Job design recommendations:** For individuals high on intrinsic motivators, job enrichment (adding meaningful content) is more effective than simply improving hygiene factors

3. **Engagement strategies:** Organizations can use MQ profiles to determine whether engagement issues stem from hygiene deficits (requiring contextual fixes) or lack of intrinsic motivators (requiring work redesign)

4. **Modern extensions:** The MQ updates Herzberg's framework by incorporating contemporary factors like work-life balance, which has become more salient in recent years

## Self-Determination Theory (Autonomy/Competence/Relatedness)

**Self-Determination Theory (SDT)**, developed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, provides the third major theoretical pillar for the MQ. SDT posits that human motivation exists on a continuum from extrinsic (externally regulated) to intrinsic (self-motivated), and that three fundamental psychological needs must be satisfied for optimal functioning and well-being:

### Autonomy

**Autonomy** is the need to experience self-direction and personal agency in one's actions. Autonomy satisfaction occurs when individuals:

- Feel they have choice and volition in their work
- Can initiate and regulate their own behavior
- Work in alignment with their authentic values and interests
- Are not subject to excessive external control or micromanagement

Autonomy does not mean independence or isolation; rather, it reflects the experience of acting from one's true self rather than from external pressures or contingencies.

**MQ Connection:** The MQ directly measures **Autonomy** as one of its three Intrinsic dimensions, specifically capturing the need for independence and self-direction. High scores predict preference for roles with discretion and latitude; low scores may indicate comfort with structure and clear direction. The **Flexibility** dimension (tolerance for ambiguity) is also related, as autonomous work often requires navigating unstructured environments.

### Competence

**Competence** is the need to feel effective and masterful in one's interactions with the environment. Competence satisfaction occurs when individuals:

- Experience themselves as capable and skilled
- Receive positive feedback on their performance
- Face optimal challenges that stretch but don't overwhelm their abilities
- Experience growth in their capabilities over time

This need drives people to seek challenges and develop expertise, and it underlies the satisfaction derived from achievement.

**MQ Connection:** Several MQ dimensions relate to competence needs:
- **Achievement:** Direct measure of the need to overcome challenges and demonstrate mastery
- **Personal Growth:** Desire for development opportunities and skill expansion
- **Fear of Failure:** The negative pole—concern about not demonstrating competence
- **Recognition:** External validation of competence through acknowledgment
- **Immersion:** Deep engagement in work, often associated with flow states where competence is tested

### Relatedness

**Relatedness** is the need to feel connected to others, to care for and be cared for, and to have a sense of belongingness. Relatedness satisfaction occurs when individuals:

- Experience meaningful connection with colleagues
- Feel valued and supported by their work community
- Can contribute to others' well-being
- Are part of a cohesive team or organizational culture

Relatedness is fundamental to human well-being and affects both motivation and mental health.

**MQ Connection:** The MQ's **Affiliation** dimension (within the Synergy domain) directly measures relatedness needs, capturing the desire for teamwork and helping others. The **Recognition** dimension also relates to relatedness, as social acknowledgment reinforces one's connection to and value within the group.

### Integrated Theoretical Framework

SDT's three needs map elegantly onto the MQ structure:

| SDT Need | MQ Dimensions | Domain Grouping |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Autonomy** | Autonomy, Flexibility | Intrinsic |
| **Competence** | Achievement, Personal Growth, Fear of Failure (reversed), Recognition, Immersion | Energy & Dynamism, Synergy |
| **Relatedness** | Affiliation, Recognition | Synergy |

### Self-Determination Theory Insights

SDT contributes several key insights to MQ interpretation:

1. **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation:** SDT distinguishes between autonomous motivation (intrinsic, integrated regulation) and controlled motivation (external, introjected regulation). Individuals high on Intrinsic MQ dimensions (Interest, Autonomy, Flexibility) likely experience more autonomous motivation, while those high on Extrinsic dimensions (Material Reward, Status, Progression) may be more controllably motivated. Research shows autonomous motivation predicts better performance, engagement, and well-being.

2. **Need Satisfaction and Engagement:** SDT predicts that individuals whose work environments satisfy all three needs will experience optimal motivation, engagement, and well-being. MQ profiles can identify whether an individual's needs align with what their role provides:
   - High **Autonomy** need + micromanaged role = demotivation
   - High **Affiliation** need + isolated role = demotivation
   - High **Achievement** need + routine role = demotivation

3. **Internalization Process:** SDT describes how externally regulated behaviors can become internalized and self-determined over time. An individual initially motivated by Material Reward (extrinsic) may, if autonomy needs are satisfied, develop intrinsic Interest in the work itself. MQ profiles can track this evolution.

4. **Universal Needs, Individual Differences:** While SDT posits that autonomy, competence, and relatedness are universal human needs, individuals differ in the strength of these needs. The MQ captures these individual differences, allowing for personalized predictions about which environments will support thriving.

## Content Theories of Motivation: Integrated Framework

The MQ synthesizes insights from these three major theories (McClelland, Herzberg, SDT) alongside additional research on workplace values to create a comprehensive framework. This integration recognizes that:

### Multiple Motivational Systems

Human motivation is multifaceted. The MQ acknowledges that people are simultaneously motivated by:
- **Achievement and competence** (from McClelland and SDT)
- **Social connection and affiliation** (from McClelland and SDT)
- **Power and influence** (from McClelland)
- **Intrinsic interest in work** (from Herzberg and SDT)
- **Extrinsic rewards and recognition** (from Herzberg)
- **Autonomy and self-direction** (from SDT)
- **Security and stability** (from Herzberg's hygiene factors)

### Hierarchical Structure

The MQ's four domain groupings reflect a theoretical synthesis:

**Energy & Dynamism:** Focuses on the active, driving forces of motivation—the energy people bring to work through achievement, competition, power-seeking, and activity level. This domain synthesizes McClelland's achievement and power needs with aspects of competence from SDT.

**Synergy:** Focuses on environmental and social factors that support motivation—affiliation, recognition, personal growth, security, and ethical alignment. This domain synthesizes McClelland's affiliation need, Herzberg's motivators (recognition, growth) and hygiene factors (security), and SDT's relatedness.

**Intrinsic:** Focuses on motivation derived from the work itself—interest, flexibility, and autonomy. This domain directly reflects Herzberg's motivators and SDT's autonomy need.

**Extrinsic:** Focuses on external rewards and outcomes—material reward, progression, and status. This domain reflects Herzberg's hygiene factors and external regulation in SDT.

### Stable Individual Differences

The theoretical framework assumes that motivational preferences are relatively stable traits (similar to personality) rather than temporary states. This assumption allows the MQ to:
- Predict long-term fit between person and role
- Inform career development strategies
- Identify engagement risks before they manifest

### Context-Dependent Expression

While motivational preferences are stable, their satisfaction depends on the environment. The MQ framework explicitly recognizes this person-environment interaction:
- A person high in Affiliation needs will thrive in collaborative teams but struggle in isolated roles
- A person high in Autonomy needs will excel in ambiguous, self-directed work but chafe under micromanagement
- A person high in Material Reward motivation will be energized by performance-based compensation but may disengage if pay is not competitive

## Theoretical Refinement and Modernization

The MQ has been updated over time (the current version is often labeled **MQM5**) with refinements that reflect contemporary workplace contexts. Key updates include:

### Work-Life Balance

Motivational factors around work-life balance have become more salient in recent years and are explicitly assessed in the current version of the MQ. This reflects generational shifts in values, with younger workers often prioritizing flexibility and personal time alongside traditional motivators like progression and material reward.

### Contemporary Wording

The MQ items have been modernized to reflect contemporary work contexts, including references to remote work, flexible arrangements, and modern organizational structures. This ensures that the theoretical constructs remain relevant to current employees.

### Emerging Values

SHL's ongoing research explores whether new motivational factors are emerging in the contemporary workforce, such as:
- **Environmental and sustainability values:** Motivation derived from working for organizations with strong environmental commitments
- **Social impact and purpose:** Motivation from contributing to social good beyond profit
- **Continuous learning:** Motivation from access to development and learning opportunities (related to but distinct from Personal Growth)

These explorations reflect the MQ's commitment to remaining grounded in robust theory while adapting to evolving workplace realities.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Theoretical Integration:** The MQ integrates three major motivation theories—McClelland's needs theory, Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory, and Self-Determination Theory—into a comprehensive framework measuring 18 workplace motivators.

2. **Content Theory Foundation:** As a content theory, the MQ focuses on *what* motivates people (specific needs and values) rather than *how* motivation processes unfold, making it ideal for assessing stable individual differences.

3. **McClelland's Contribution:** The MQ directly measures McClelland's three core needs—Achievement, Power, and Affiliation—while extending beyond them to capture additional workplace drivers.

4. **Herzberg's Distinction:** The MQ reflects Herzberg's distinction between hygiene factors (which prevent dissatisfaction) and motivators (which create satisfaction), organized through its Extrinsic and Intrinsic domain groupings.

5. **SDT's Three Needs:** Self-Determination Theory's three fundamental needs—Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness—are represented across multiple MQ dimensions, with autonomy measured directly in the Intrinsic domain.

6. **Person-Environment Fit:** The theoretical framework emphasizes that motivation arises from the alignment between individual preferences (measured by the MQ) and environmental characteristics (role features, culture), predicting engagement and retention.

7. **Stable yet Context-Dependent:** The MQ assumes motivational preferences are stable traits (allowing long-term predictions) but their satisfaction depends on environmental context (requiring careful person-job matching).

8. **Continuous Evolution:** The MQ is regularly updated to reflect contemporary workplace values (e.g., work-life balance) while maintaining its theoretical foundation, ensuring ongoing relevance.
