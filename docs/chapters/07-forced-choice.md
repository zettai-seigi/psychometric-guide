# Chapter 7: Forced-Choice Format and Faking Resistance

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand socially desirable responding and faking in personality assessment
- Recognize the limitations of normative Likert-type scales in high-stakes contexts
- Grasp the forced-choice (ipsative) format rationale
- Identify the psychometric problems created by classical ipsative scoring

## Note

**This chapter's detailed content is not yet available in the current source materials.**

Based on the table of contents, this chapter should cover:
- Impression management and faking behavior
- The forced-choice triplet format
- Interdependence of ipsative scores
- The inability to make between-person comparisons with classical scoring
- The rationale for adopting forced-choice methodology

For complete information on this topic, please refer to:
- The SHL OPQ32 Technical Manual
- Research on socially desirable responding in personality assessment
- Official SHL documentation on the OPQ32r format

## Faking in Personality Assessment

One of the major challenges in high-stakes personality assessment is **socially desirable responding** (faking):
- Candidates may present themselves more favorably than they truly are
- This is particularly problematic in selection contexts
- Can reduce the validity of personality assessments
- Threatens the fairness of the selection process

## The Forced-Choice Solution

To address faking, SHL implemented a **forced-choice format**:

### The Triplet Format

The OPQ32r uses blocks of three statements where respondents must:
- Choose which statement is "Most like me"
- Choose which statement is "Least like me"

This format makes it difficult to fake because:
- All statements are matched for social desirability
- Choosing one favorable statement means rejecting another equally favorable one
- The format forces trade-offs between equally attractive options

### The Ipsative Problem

However, forced-choice formats create psychometric challenges:
- Scores become **interdependent** (constant-sum constraint)
- Classical scoring produces ipsative data
- Ipsative scores indicate relative standing **within** the person, not **between** people
- Makes between-person comparisons problematic
- Distorts factor analysis and reliability estimates
- Limits validity for criterion validation

## The Need for Advanced Scoring

The limitations of classical ipsative scoring created the need for a breakthrough methodology - which was achieved through Thurstonian Item Response Theory (covered in Chapter 8).

## Key Takeaways

1. Socially desirable responding (faking) is a significant concern in high-stakes personality assessment
2. Forced-choice formats effectively reduce faking by requiring trade-offs between equally desirable options
3. The OPQ32r uses a triplet format where respondents choose "most" and "least" like me
4. Classical scoring of forced-choice data creates ipsative scores with interdependence problems
5. The ipsative problem was solved through advanced Thurstonian IRT methodology
6. The forced-choice format represents SHL's commitment to maintaining assessment validity in high-stakes contexts
