## Key Takeaways

1. **Probabilistic Framework:** IRT models the probability of correct responses as a function of ability and item parameters
2. **2PL Model:** Verify uses two-parameter logistic model with difficulty and discrimination parameters
3. **Theta Scores:** Ability is estimated as theta on a continuous scale, with associated standard errors
4. **Information Functions:** IRT quantifies measurement precision across the ability range
5. **CAT Foundation:** IRT parameters enable Computer Adaptive Testing algorithms
6. **Superior to CTT:** IRT provides item-invariant ability estimates and person-invariant item parameters
