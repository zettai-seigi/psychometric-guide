1. Explain the Likert-type format used by the MQ (5-point scale)
2. Describe Classical Test Theory (CTT) scoring methodology
3. Explain how Cronbach's alpha assesses MQ reliability
4. Describe the reliability threshold (0.75-0.85) for MQ scales
5. Explain sten score conversion and interpretation
6. Describe the typical MQ format (~150 items, 25 minutes)
7. Compare MQ's CTT approach to OPQ32r and Verify's IRT methods
8. Interpret MQ scores using norm groups
