# Chapter 5: The 32 Traits and Three Domains

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Master the three-domain structure (Relationships with People, Thinking Style, Feelings and Emotions)
- Identify all 32 specific traits and their measurement focus
- Understand how traits map to workplace behaviors and competencies
- Recognize the alignment with Big Five personality factors and workplace-specific constructs
- Grasp the hierarchical organization from domains to sub-categories to individual traits

## Introduction: A Workplace-Focused Trait Model

The OPQ32 measures **32 distinct traits of behavioral style** that are specifically relevant to job performance. Unlike general personality inventories that were designed for clinical or research purposes, the OPQ32 was constructed from the ground up with a singular focus: measuring personality characteristics that matter in the workplace.

This work-centric focus is evident in every aspect of the instrument:

- **Content Selection**: Only content relevant to job performance is included. Items were phrased behaviorally for each trait domain, including questions about preferences for working with others, leading, complying with rules, and handling workplace stress.
- **Theoretical Grounding**: While aligned with the academic Big Five personality factors (Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Emotional Stability, and Openness), the OPQ32 provides finer-grained measurement specifically tailored to workplace behaviors.
- **Predictive Validity**: The 32 traits were designed to predict workplace competencies and job performance, not general life outcomes or clinical conditions.

The 32 traits are organized into **three major domains** that comprehensively cover workplace-relevant personality: Relationships with People, Thinking Style, and Feelings and Emotions. Within these domains, traits are further grouped into **sub-categories** that reflect different facets of interpersonal, cognitive, and emotional style at work.

## The Three-Domain Structure

### Domain 1: Relationships with People

This domain captures interpersonal style and social orientation in the workplace. It addresses fundamental questions about how individuals interact with colleagues, customers, and stakeholders:

- How do they prefer to influence others?
- Do they seek out social interaction or prefer to work independently?
- How do they approach collaboration and supporting others?
- What is their comfort level in social situations?

The Relationships with People domain encompasses **10 traits** organized into three sub-categories:

#### Sub-Category: Influence

This sub-category measures preferences for exercising authority and influencing others in the workplace.

1. **Persuasive**: Enjoys negotiating and convincing others. High scorers prefer to change people's views through argument and discussion. They are comfortable in sales and influencing roles.

2. **Controlling**: Takes charge, directs, and manages others. High scorers prefer leadership positions, like making decisions for the group, and are comfortable exercising authority.

3. **Outspoken**: Expresses opinions freely and challenges others' views. High scorers are comfortable voicing disagreement, speaking up in meetings, and making their positions known.

4. **Independent Minded**: Follows own approach rather than seeking guidance. High scorers prefer to work autonomously, making their own decisions without consulting others frequently.

**Workplace Relevance**: These traits are critical predictors of leadership potential and managerial style. The "Leading and Deciding" competency (one of the Great Eight competency factors) draws heavily on traits like Controlling, Persuasive, and Outspoken. Individuals high on Influence traits tend to gravitate toward roles requiring direction-setting, persuasion, and assertive communication.

#### Sub-Category: Sociability

This sub-category assesses social interaction preferences and comfort in company.

5. **Outgoing**: Lively, talkative, and socially energetic. High scorers enjoy being around people, initiate conversations easily, and bring energy to social situations.

6. **Affiliative**: Has a strong need for company and close relationships at work. High scorers prefer collaborative work environments, value team membership, and may feel uncomfortable working alone for extended periods.

7. **Socially Confident**: Comfortable with strangers and in new social situations. High scorers find it easy to approach new people, speak in front of groups, and navigate unfamiliar social contexts without anxiety.

**Workplace Relevance**: Sociability traits predict success in customer-facing roles, team environments, and positions requiring networking and relationship building. The "Interacting and Presenting" competency is strongly influenced by these traits. High scorers excel in sales, consulting, and any role requiring frequent interpersonal engagement.

#### Sub-Category: Empathy

This sub-category measures social cohesion, consideration for others, and team orientation.

8. **Modest**: Reserved about personal achievements. High scorers downplay their successes, avoid the spotlight, and may deflect recognition to others or the team.

9. **Democratic**: Consultative and participative in decision-making. High scorers seek input from others, value team consensus, and prefer collaborative rather than autocratic leadership styles.

10. **Caring**: Sympathetic, considerate, and helpful toward others. High scorers are sensitive to others' feelings, offer support readily, and prioritize maintaining positive relationships.

**Workplace Relevance**: Empathy traits predict success in team-based environments, coaching and mentoring roles, and positions requiring collaboration and stakeholder management. The "Supporting and Cooperating" competency (Great Eight) is marked by traits like Caring, Democratic, and Affiliative. These traits are also negatively correlated with derailment risks related to arrogance and insensitivity.

**Domain Alignment**: The Relationships with People domain aligns primarily with the Big Five factors of **Extraversion** (Sociability traits) and **Agreeableness** (Empathy traits). The Influence sub-category represents a workplace-specific facet that combines elements of both Extraversion (social assertiveness) and low Agreeableness (willingness to challenge and compete).

### Domain 2: Thinking Style

This domain measures cognitive preferences and approaches to information, problem-solving, and work organization. It addresses questions about how individuals prefer to think and work:

- How do they approach data and analysis?
- Do they prefer innovation or convention?
- How do they organize their work?
- What is their tolerance for ambiguity and change?

The Thinking Style domain encompasses **12 traits** organized into three sub-categories:

#### Sub-Category: Analysis

This sub-category focuses on information processing and critical thinking preferences.

11. **Data Rational**: Likes working with numbers, data, and quantitative information. High scorers prefer to base decisions on data, enjoy statistical analysis, and are comfortable with numerical reasoning tasks.

12. **Evaluative**: Critical thinker who analyzes information skeptically. High scorers question assumptions, critically evaluate arguments, and are comfortable challenging ideas and proposals.

13. **Behavioral**: Analyzes people's behavior and motivations. High scorers are interested in understanding why people act as they do, enjoy discussing psychological concepts, and may excel in roles requiring insight into human behavior.

**Workplace Relevance**: Analysis traits are critical predictors of the "Analyzing and Interpreting" competency. The competency prediction uses OPQ traits such as Data Rational, Evaluative, and Conceptual in a weighted formula. These traits predict success in analytical roles, research positions, and any job requiring critical evaluation of information. Notably, the Universal Competency Report (UCR) integrates personality preference (high Data Rational) with cognitive capacity (Verify Numerical Ability scores) using a "Penalty Function" - if someone likes numbers but scores low on numerical reasoning, the overall competency prediction is adjusted downward.

#### Sub-Category: Creativity and Change

This sub-category assesses preferences for innovation, novelty, and adaptability.

14. **Conventional**: Prefers the status quo and established methods. High scorers are comfortable with traditional approaches, prefer proven methods, and may resist organizational change.

15. **Conceptual**: Theoretical thinker who enjoys abstract ideas. High scorers are comfortable with theory, enjoy discussing concepts and models, and prefer strategic thinking over tactical execution.

16. **Innovative**: Generates new ideas and creative solutions. High scorers enjoy brainstorming, propose novel approaches, and are energized by opportunities for creativity.

17. **Variety Seeking**: Likes change and diversity in work. High scorers prefer varied tasks, enjoy new experiences, and may become bored with routine work.

18. **Adaptable**: Flexible and comfortable with ambiguity. High scorers adjust easily to changing circumstances, are comfortable with uncertainty, and can shift approaches when needed.

**Workplace Relevance**: Creativity and Change traits predict success in innovation-focused roles, change management positions, and dynamic environments. The "Creating and Conceptualizing" competency (Great Eight) covers innovation, strategic thinking, and openness to change. These traits align with the Big Five factor of Openness to Experience. High scorers on Innovative, Conceptual, and Variety Seeking excel in strategy consulting, product development, and entrepreneurial roles.

#### Sub-Category: Structure

This sub-category measures preferences for planning, organization, and adherence to rules and procedures.

19. **Forward Thinking**: Strategic and future-oriented. High scorers think ahead, plan for long-term consequences, and prefer strategic over tactical work.

20. **Detail Conscious**: Precise and attentive to detail. High scorers focus on accuracy, notice small errors, and approach tasks methodically to ensure precision.

21. **Conscientious**: Sticks to deadlines and commitments. High scorers are reliable, feel obligated to complete work on time, and may feel anxious if deadlines are at risk.

22. **Rule Following**: Adheres to procedures and regulations. High scorers prefer clear guidelines, follow established protocols, and are uncomfortable bending rules even when expedient.

**Workplace Relevance**: Structure traits are the primary predictors of the "Organizing and Executing" competency (Great Eight), which relates to planning, reliability, and delivering quality results. These traits align strongly with the Big Five factor of Conscientiousness. The composite Big Five Conscientiousness scale derived from OPQ32 loads on Conscientious, Detail Conscious, Forward Thinking, and Achieving traits. In the UCR narrative, a high score on Detail Conscious might generate text like: "Likely to pay close attention to details and approach tasks in a methodical manner."

**Domain Alignment**: The Thinking Style domain aligns with multiple Big Five factors. Analysis traits relate to Openness (intellectual curiosity) and are also moderated by General Mental Ability (GMA). Creativity and Change traits map to Openness. Structure traits map directly to Conscientiousness. This domain demonstrates how the OPQ32 provides finer-grained measurement than the Big Five while maintaining theoretical coherence with established personality science.

### Domain 3: Feelings and Emotions

This domain assesses emotional style, resilience, and motivational drive in the workplace. It addresses questions about:

- How do individuals respond to stress and pressure?
- What drives them to achieve and compete?
- How do they manage emotions at work?
- What is their typical energy level and pace preference?

The Feelings and Emotions domain encompasses **10 traits** organized into two sub-categories:

#### Sub-Category: Emotions

This sub-category measures emotional resilience and responses to stress.

23. **Relaxed**: Calm under pressure and rarely tense. High scorers remain composed in stressful situations, don't worry excessively, and maintain emotional equilibrium.

24. **Worrying**: Anxious before important events. High scorers tend to anticipate problems, feel nervous about upcoming challenges, and may ruminate on potential negative outcomes.

25. **Tough Minded**: Insensitive to criticism and emotionally detached. High scorers are not easily hurt by negative feedback, remain objective about criticism, and don't take things personally.

26. **Optimistic**: Maintains a positive outlook. High scorers expect positive outcomes, focus on opportunities rather than threats, and maintain enthusiasm even in difficult circumstances.

27. **Trusting**: Believes others are honest and well-intentioned. High scorers take people at their word, assume positive intent, and are comfortable delegating without excessive oversight.

28. **Emotionally Controlled**: Masks feelings and maintains composure. High scorers hide emotions from others, maintain a professional demeanor regardless of internal feelings, and rarely display emotional reactions visibly.

**Workplace Relevance**: Emotion traits are critical predictors of the "Adapting and Coping" competency (Great Eight), which focuses on emotional resilience and responding to change. This competency is positively influenced by traits like Relaxed and Adaptable, and negatively by Worrying. These traits align with the Big Five factor of Emotional Stability (the inverse of Neuroticism). The composite Big Five Emotional Stability score draws on Relaxed (positive weight) and Worrying (negative weight). High scorers on resilience traits (Relaxed, Tough Minded, Optimistic) excel in high-pressure roles, crisis management, and leadership positions.

#### Sub-Category: Dynamism

This sub-category assesses drive, competitive motivation, and energy level.

29. **Vigorous**: Thrives on activity and fast pace. High scorers maintain high energy levels, prefer busy work environments, and are energized by multiple concurrent demands.

30. **Competitive**: Driven to win and outperform others. High scorers enjoy competition, measure themselves against others, and are motivated by comparative performance metrics.

31. **Achieving**: Ambitious and goal-oriented. High scorers set high standards for themselves, are motivated by accomplishment, and derive satisfaction from meeting challenging objectives.

32. **Decisive**: Makes quick decisions without hesitation. High scorers are comfortable making rapid judgments, don't agonize over choices, and prefer action to prolonged deliberation.

**Workplace Relevance**: Dynamism traits predict the "Enterprising and Performing" competency (Great Eight), marked by traits like Achieving, Competitive, and Vigorous. These traits represent a workplace-specific Achievement orientation factor that goes beyond the standard Big Five model. The marker scales for this competency often receive weighted scoring (e.g., 2:1:1 weighting for the primary traits). High scorers on Dynamism traits excel in sales, entrepreneurial roles, and any position requiring sustained drive and competitive spirit.

**Domain Alignment**: The Feelings and Emotions domain aligns primarily with Big Five Emotional Stability (Emotions sub-category) but also includes a distinct Achievement orientation factor (Dynamism sub-category) that represents additional workplace-relevant variance beyond the standard Big Five model.

## Trait Integration and Workplace Behavior

### From Traits to Competencies

The 32 traits don't operate in isolation. The OPQ32's power lies in how these traits combine to predict workplace competencies through the Universal Competency Framework (UCF).

**The Mapping Process**: Psychometric experts and occupational psychologists collaborated to map each OPQ32 trait explicitly onto the UCF competency dimensions based on theoretical links and empirical validation research. This mapping creates **equation sets** where:

- Each competency is predicted by multiple OPQ32 traits
- Traits can serve as positive or negative predictors
- Each trait receives a specific weighting based on validation research
- The formula structure is: Competency Potential Score = sum of (weighted trait scores)

**Example Competency Mappings**:

1. **Leading and Deciding**: Draws on traits like Controlling (primary), Outspoken, Persuasive, and Decisive. High scorers on these traits show strong potential for leadership roles.

2. **Analyzing and Interpreting**: Influenced by Data Rational, Evaluative, and Conceptual traits. The narrative might note "Strengths: Prefers to base decisions on data (high Data Rational) and critically evaluates information (high Evaluative)" while noting "Limiting factors: Tends to follow established methods rather than seek innovative solutions (high Conventional, lower Innovative)."

3. **Supporting and Cooperating**: Marked by Caring, Democratic, and Affiliative traits, measuring social cohesion and team orientation.

4. **Adapting and Coping**: Positively influenced by Relaxed and Adaptable, negatively by Worrying.

### The Great Eight Connection

The UCF's highest tier consists of eight general competency factors (the "Great Eight") that correlate strongly with the Big Five personality factors but are framed in the active language of corporate utility:

1. **Leading and Deciding**: Related to Extraversion and Need for Power
2. **Supporting and Cooperating**: Related to Agreeableness
3. **Interacting and Presenting**: Related to Extraversion and GMA
4. **Analyzing and Interpreting**: Related to GMA and Openness
5. **Creating and Conceptualizing**: Related to Openness and GMA
6. **Organizing and Executing**: Related to Conscientiousness and GMA
7. **Adapting and Coping**: Related to Emotional Stability
8. **Enterprising and Performing**: Related to Achievement orientation

Each Great Eight factor maps to specific OPQ32 marker scales that receive primary weighting in the competency prediction formula.

### Narrative Reporting

The OPQ32's trait scores drive automated narrative generation through an expert system logic where psychologists wrote interpretive text for every possible score range on every trait and combinations of traits.

**Manager Plus Report Example**: If a person scores high on Detail Conscious, a bullet point might read: "Likely to pay close attention to details and approach tasks in a methodical manner." If the score is low, the text might state: "May not enjoy tasks that require careful attention to detail."

**Universal Competency Report (UCR) Example**: The UCR synthesizes traits into competency narratives. For a candidate scoring low on "Leading and Deciding," the software selects text noting they prefer not to take charge, drawing this inference from low scores on traits like Controlling or Outspoken.

This algorithmic translation converts abstract personality trait scores into concrete behavioral predictions phrased in business language, making the results actionable for HR professionals and line managers.

## Granularity and Specificity

### Why 32 Traits?

The decision to measure 32 distinct traits (rather than just the Big Five or a smaller set) reflects SHL's commitment to workplace-relevant specificity:

1. **Finer-Grained Prediction**: While the Big Five provide broad personality structure, workplace performance often depends on specific behavioral tendencies. For example, "Conscientiousness" is useful, but knowing whether someone is more Detail Conscious vs. Forward Thinking vs. Rule Following provides actionable insight for job placement and development.

2. **Competency Mapping Precision**: The UCF competency prediction algorithms require multiple specific inputs. Broad factors would provide less precise prediction than the 32-trait model.

3. **Development Targeting**: For coaching and development purposes, knowing a general factor score is less useful than understanding specific trait strengths and limitations. A manager can provide more targeted feedback with 32-trait data.

4. **Empirical Validation**: Factor-analytic studies confirm that the OPQ32's 32-trait structure replicates across cultures and aligns with both theoretical expectations (Big Five congruence) and practical utility (competency prediction validity).

### Comparison to Competitors

When compared to other major occupational personality inventories:

- **Hogan HPI**: Measures 7 primary scales aligned with Big Five, providing less granularity than OPQ32's 32 traits
- **Saville Wave**: Measures 36 facets mapped onto 4 clusters and 12 sections, comparable granularity to OPQ32
- **NEO-PI-R** (research instrument): Measures 30 facets under the Big Five, similar specificity but not workplace-focused

The OPQ32's 32-trait structure balances comprehensiveness with interpretability, avoiding both the oversimplification of broad factor models and the complexity of overly atomized trait lists.

## Psychometric Properties

### Reliability

The OPQ32r demonstrates strong internal consistency reliability across the 32 scales:

- Target reliability coefficients exceed 0.70 for trait scales
- Technical documentation confirms strong psychometric properties
- The Thurstonian IRT scoring (covered in Chapter 8) maintains or improves reliability compared to classical ipsative scoring

### Construct Validity

Multiple lines of evidence support the construct validity of the 32-trait structure:

1. **Factor-Analytic Studies**: Confirm that the OPQ32's structure is congruent with the Big Five personality factors while providing additional workplace-specific variance

2. **Big Five Mapping**: Research by Bartram and Brown mapped 25 of the 32 scales to the Five Factor Model using weighted composites with reliability coefficients approximately 0.89

3. **Cross-Cultural Replication**: Structural equation modeling confirms cross-cultural equivalence across 31 countries and 20+ languages, demonstrating that the 32-trait structure holds universally

4. **Criterion Validity**: Continuous validation studies confirm that the traits correlate with job performance criteria and competency ratings

### Discriminant Validity

The 32 traits are conceptually distinct and empirically separable:

- Factor analysis confirms the 32 dimensions measure distinct constructs
- Inter-scale correlations are generally moderate, supporting discriminant validity
- The Thurstonian IRT scoring recovers the multidimensional structure from forced-choice data

## Practical Applications

### Selection and Assessment

The 32 traits enable precise person-job matching:

- **Role Requirements**: Different jobs require different trait profiles. Sales roles may prioritize Persuasive, Outgoing, and Competitive traits, while quality assurance roles may prioritize Detail Conscious, Conscientious, and Rule Following

- **Cultural Fit**: The interpersonal traits (Relationships with People domain) predict fit with organizational culture and team dynamics

- **Performance Prediction**: The trait-to-competency mapping provides empirically-based prediction of job performance potential

### Development and Coaching

The 32-trait profile provides a roadmap for targeted development:

- **Strength Identification**: Coaches can identify natural strengths and suggest roles or projects that leverage these traits

- **Development Planning**: Specific traits can be targeted for development (e.g., building Socially Confident skills for someone transitioning to client-facing work)

- **Self-Awareness**: The detailed profile helps individuals understand their natural preferences and potential blind spots

### Team Composition

Understanding the 32-trait profiles of team members enables:

- **Complementary Strengths**: Building teams with diverse but complementary trait profiles

- **Conflict Prevention**: Anticipating potential interpersonal conflicts based on trait combinations

- **Role Allocation**: Assigning project roles based on trait fit (e.g., the high Controlling, Outspoken person leads; the high Caring, Democratic person facilitates)

## Integration with the Complete SHL Assessment Suite

The OPQ32's 32 traits don't stand alone. They integrate with other SHL assessments through the Universal Competency Framework:

### With Verify (Ability Tests)

The UCF competency prediction combines personality traits with cognitive ability scores. This integration recognizes that workplace success requires both preference (personality) and capacity (ability).

**DNV Logic Example**: If a candidate scores high on Data Rational (personality preference for numbers) but low on Numerical Reasoning ability, the system applies a penalty function to competencies requiring quantitative skills. The final competency score and narrative reflect this discrepancy: "Interested in data but may need support with complex analysis."

### With MQ (Motivation)

While the OPQ32 measures behavioral style (the "how" of behavior), the MQ measures motivational drivers (the "why" of behavior). The 32 traits indicate how someone is likely to behave; the MQ indicates what energizes and sustains that behavior.

### Unified Reporting

The Universal Competency Report integrates all assessment data into a single competency profile, with the 32 OPQ traits serving as the foundational personality input. This integrated approach provides a comprehensive picture of candidate potential.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Comprehensive Structure**: The OPQ32 measures 32 distinct workplace personality traits organized into three major domains (Relationships with People, Thinking Style, Feelings and Emotions) and eight sub-categories.

2. **Work-Focused Design**: Every trait was selected for workplace relevance. Only content relevant to job performance is included, with items phrased in work-behavioral terms.

3. **Theoretical Grounding**: The 32-trait structure aligns with the scientifically validated Big Five personality factors while providing finer-grained, workplace-specific measurement. Factor-analytic studies confirm this congruence.

4. **Competency Prediction**: The traits map systematically to the Universal Competency Framework's 20 dimensions and 8 Great Eight factors through validated prediction equations. Each competency draws on multiple weighted trait inputs.

5. **Practical Utility**: The 32-trait granularity enables precise person-job matching, targeted development planning, and effective team composition. The level of detail is sufficient for actionable insight without becoming overwhelming.

6. **Psychometric Rigor**: Strong reliability (>0.70 target), extensive construct validation, cross-cultural replication, and continuous criterion validation studies support the scientific quality of the 32-trait model.

7. **Integrated Assessment**: The OPQ32 traits integrate with Verify ability scores and MQ motivation scores through the UCF, enabling holistic candidate assessment.

8. **Narrative Translation**: Sophisticated expert system logic translates the 32 trait scores into business language narratives, making results accessible to non-specialists while maintaining psychometric precision.

The 32-trait, three-domain structure of the OPQ32 represents a carefully engineered balance: comprehensive enough to capture workplace personality in useful detail, yet structured enough to be interpretable and actionable. This architecture has proven robust across millions of administrations in over 30 languages and 39 countries, making it one of the most thoroughly validated occupational personality frameworks in the assessment industry.
