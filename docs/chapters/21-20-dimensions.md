# Tier 2 - The 20 Dimensions

### The Standard Operating Level

Tier 2 of the Universal Competency Framework comprises **20 more specific competency dimensions** that cluster logically under the Great Eight factors. This level represents the **standard operating level for most SHL recruitment and development reports**—the sweet spot that balances:

**Sufficient Specificity**: The 20 dimensions provide enough granularity to meaningfully distinguish between related behaviors. For example, rather than just "Leading and Deciding," reports differentiate between "Deciding and Initiating Action" (making decisions and taking action) and "Leading and Supervising" (directing and managing others).

**Manageable Comprehensiveness**: Twenty dimensions are specific enough to be actionable but not so numerous as to overwhelm users. Research on cognitive load suggests that decision-makers can effectively process and compare 15-25 distinct pieces of information; beyond that, information overload reduces decision quality.

**Convergence Point for Multi-Assessment Integration**: It is at Tier 2 where personality data (OPQ32) and ability data (Verify) converge most effectively to produce Competency Potential Scores. The mapping algorithms that translate trait scores into competency predictions operate primarily at this level.

**Client Customization Level**: While the Great Eight provide universal structure, the 20 dimensions allow for role-specific emphasis. A sales role might emphasize "Relating and Networking" and "Convincing and Selling," while an analytical role prioritizes "Analyzing" and "Applying Expertise and Technology."

### The 20 Dimensions Mapped to the Great Eight

The hierarchical structure of the UCF ensures that every Tier 2 dimension clusters logically under one of the Tier 1 factors. This provides conceptual coherence while maintaining practical specificity.

### The Power of Differentiation

The value of Tier 2's 20 dimensions becomes clear when considering how they differentiate related but distinct workplace behaviors that might be confused at the Great Eight level.

**Example 1: Different Types of Leadership**
- "Leading and Deciding" (Tier 1) is too broad for precise selection or development
- Tier 2 differentiates:
  - **Deciding and Initiating Action**: "John makes decisions quickly and takes initiative" (strong for individual contributor leadership)
  - **Leading and Supervising**: "John struggles to direct others' work" (development need for management role)
  - **Entrepreneurial and Commercial Thinking**: "John shows strong business acumen" (strength for commercial role)

**Example 2: Different Types of Communication**
- "Interacting and Presenting" (Tier 1) covers too much ground
- Tier 2 differentiates:
  - **Relating and Networking**: "Sarah builds strong relationships over time" (excellent for account management)
  - **Persuading and Influencing**: "Sarah struggles to change others' opinions" (development need for change management)
  - **Presenting and Communicating Information**: "Sarah delivers clear presentations" (strength for training role)

**Example 3: Different Types of Conscientiousness**
- "Organizing and Executing" (Tier 1) doesn't specify which aspect
- Tier 2 differentiates:
  - **Planning and Organizing**: "Mike plans projects systematically" (strength for project management)
  - **Delivering Results and Meeting Customer Expectations**: "Mike consistently meets deadlines" (strength for operations)
  - **Following Instructions and Procedures**: "Mike sometimes questions established procedures" (potential issue for compliance role, strength for innovative role)

### OPQ Trait Mappings: Building the Algorithm

Each of the 20 dimensions has a proprietary **mapping matrix** that specifies:

1. **Which of the 32 OPQ traits serve as positive predictors** (high scores increase the competency prediction)
2. **Which traits serve as negative predictors** (high scores decrease the competency prediction)
3. **The relative weighting of each trait** (how much influence each has)
4. **Whether Verify ability scores contribute** (and their weighting if so)

While SHL keeps the precise algorithms proprietary, research publications and technical manuals reveal the general mapping logic:

**Analyzing (Dimension 4.3)**
- *Positive predictors*: Data Rational (+), Evaluative (+), Conceptual (+)
- *Negative predictors*: Behavioral (-)
- *Ability influence*: Numerical Reasoning (strong +), Verbal Reasoning (moderate +)
- *Weighting ratio*: Ability β = 0.226, Personality β = 0.122 (1.85:1 ratio favoring ability)

**Adapting and Responding to Change (Dimension 7.1)**
- *Positive predictors*: Adaptable (+), Change Oriented (+), Relaxed (+)
- *Negative predictors*: Conventional (-), Worrying (-)
- *Ability influence*: Minimal

**Leading and Supervising (Dimension 1.2)**
- *Positive predictors*: Controlling (+), Outspoken (+), Decisive (+)
- *Negative predictors*: Democratic (slight -), Modest (-)
- *Ability influence*: Minimal

This mapping logic ensures that the competency predictions align with both theoretical expectations (traits that should logically predict behaviors) and empirical data (traits that actually do predict performance ratings).

### Multi-Assessment Integration at Tier 2

Tier 2 is where the UCF's multi-assessment integration achieves its fullest expression. For several dimensions, combining personality (OPQ) and ability (Verify) data significantly increases predictive validity:

**Analyzing and Interpreting Domain**:
- Personality-only validity: ρ ≈ 0.16-0.20
- Combined (P+A) validity: ρ = 0.44
- Improvement: +120% to +175%

**Interacting and Presenting Domain**:
- Personality-only validity: ρ ≈ 0.24
- Combined (P+A) validity: ρ = 0.40
- Improvement: +67%

**Creating and Conceptualizing Domain**:
- Personality-only validity: ρ ≈ 0.22
- Combined (P+A) validity: ρ = 0.36
- Improvement: +64%

**Organizing and Executing Domain**:
- Personality-only validity: ρ ≈ 0.26
- Combined (P+A) validity: ρ = 0.35
- Improvement: +35%

These dramatic validity improvements justify the complexity and cost of multi-assessment administration, demonstrating that competencies requiring both preference (personality) and power (ability) are best predicted by measuring both.

### Tier 2 in Report Generation

In a typical Universal Competency Report:

1. **Section Organization**: After an overview, the report presents sections for each Great Eight factor
2. **Dimension Detail**: Within each factor section, the relevant Tier 2 dimensions are presented with:
   - **Competency Potential Score**: Often a 1-10 scale or percentile showing predicted potential
   - **Graphical Display**: Bar chart or similar visualization
   - **Narrative Explanation**: Text describing which OPQ traits (and ability scores, if included) contributed to the prediction
   - **Positive Factors**: "Likely strengths that support this competency..."
   - **Limiting Factors**: "Characteristics that may constrain performance in this area..."

3. **Comparative Profile**: A summary chart shows all 20 dimensions on a single page for quick visual comparison

4. **Development Priorities**: The report may flag dimensions where competency potential is particularly high or low relative to role requirements

### Balancing Specificity and Usability

Twenty dimensions represents a careful balance:

**Enough Specificity**: Differentiate between related behaviors, enable targeted development, allow role-specific customization

**Not Too Many**: Avoid overwhelming users, maintain comprehensibility, ensure each dimension is meaningfully distinct

Research on the UCF considered whether additional dimensions would improve the framework. Factor analysis suggested that going beyond 20 dimensions:
- Produces unstable factors that don't replicate across samples
- Creates excessive overlap between dimensions
- Overwhelms end-users with too much detail
- Doesn't significantly improve predictive validity

Conversely, reducing below 20 dimensions (say, to 12 or 15) loses important differentiations that matter for real-world talent decisions.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Standard Operating Level**: The 20 dimensions represent the optimal balance of specificity and comprehensiveness for most assessment purposes.

2. **Hierarchical Organization**: All 20 dimensions cluster logically under the eight Great Eight factors, maintaining conceptual coherence.

3. **Meaningful Differentiation**: The 20 dimensions distinguish related but distinct workplace behaviors—for example, separating "Deciding and Initiating" from "Leading and Supervising" from "Entrepreneurial Thinking."

4. **Convergence Point**: Tier 2 is where personality (OPQ) and ability (Verify) data converge most effectively to produce Competency Potential Scores.

5. **Proprietary Mapping**: Each dimension has a specific algorithm defining which OPQ traits (and ability scores) predict it, with specific weightings.

6. **Multi-Assessment Value**: Several dimensions show dramatic validity improvements when personality and ability are combined, justifying integrated assessment.

7. **Report Organization**: In practice, reports present the 20 dimensions grouped under Great Eight headings, with scores, narratives, and developmental guidance for each.

8. **Practical Balance**: Twenty dimensions is enough to be specific and actionable but not so many as to overwhelm decision-makers or lose conceptual clarity.

9. **Role Customization**: Organizations can emphasize different dimensions for different roles while maintaining a common competency language.

10. **OPQ Trait Examples**: Specific mappings include Data Rational/Evaluative/Conceptual → Analyzing; Controlling/Outspoken → Leading and Supervising; Relaxed/Optimistic → Coping with Pressure.

- **Formulating Strategies and Concepts** focuses on big-picture, long-term thinking

An individual might be strong at learning but not particularly innovative, or highly innovative but poor at strategic planning.

#### Under Factor 6: Organizing and Executing

**6.1 Planning and Organizing**
- **Definition**: Plans ahead, organizes work systematically, manages time effectively, coordinates activities.
- **Key OPQ Predictors**: Forward Planning (positive), Detail Conscious (positive), Achieving (positive)
- **Cognitive Predictor**: Moderate—supports complex planning
- **Example Behaviors**: Creating detailed project plans, organizing work systematically, managing multiple priorities, coordinating resources
- **Role Relevance**: Project management, operations, administrative roles, any role requiring complex coordination

**6.2 Delivering Results and Meeting Customer Expectations**
- **Definition**: Focuses on achieving results, meets commitments and deadlines, delivers quality work, ensures customer satisfaction.
- **Key OPQ Predictors**: Achieving (positive), Conscientious (positive), Competitive (positive—for results focus)
- **Example Behaviors**: Meeting deadlines consistently, ensuring work meets quality standards, following through on commitments, focusing on customer needs

**6.3 Following Instructions and Procedures**
- **Definition**: Follows established procedures and policies, adheres to rules and guidelines, works within prescribed systems.
- **Key OPQ Predictors**: Conscientious (positive), Rule Following (positive), Innovative (negative when extreme—may resist procedures)
- **Example Behaviors**: Following organizational policies, adhering to standard procedures, working within established guidelines, maintaining compliance
- **Role Relevance**: Regulated industries (healthcare, finance), compliance roles, quality assurance, process-driven roles

**Distinguishing the Three Dimensions**: All reflect Conscientiousness but with different emphases:
- **Planning and Organizing** focuses on structuring work proactively
- **Delivering Results and Meeting Customer Expectations** focuses on achievement and quality
- **Following Instructions and Procedures** focuses on adherence to established systems

Different roles have different priorities—creative roles need Planning but not excessive Following of Procedures; compliance roles need strict adherence to procedures.

#### Under Factor 7: Adapting and Coping

**7.1 Adapting and Responding to Change**
- **Definition**: Adapts positively to changing circumstances, shows flexibility, embraces organizational change, adjusts approach when needed.
- **Key OPQ Predictors**: Adaptable (positive), Change Oriented (positive), Conventional (negative)
- **Example Behaviors**: Adjusting to new processes or systems, embracing organizational changes, showing flexibility when plans change, adapting approach based on feedback
- **Role Relevance**: Dynamic environments, organizational change contexts, agile workplaces, startup/scale-up companies

**7.2 Coping with Pressures and Setbacks**
- **Definition**: Maintains composure under pressure, handles stress effectively, recovers from setbacks, maintains performance in difficult conditions.
- **Key OPQ Predictors**: Relaxed (positive), Optimistic (positive), Worrying (negative), Tough Minded (positive)
- **Example Behaviors**: Remaining calm during crises, handling criticism constructively, recovering quickly from disappointments, maintaining performance under pressure
- **Role Relevance**: High-pressure roles, customer service (difficult clients), emergency services, financial markets, healthcare

**Distinguishing the Two Dimensions**: Both reflect Emotional Stability but with different emphases:
- **Adapting and Responding to Change** focuses on flexibility and adjustment to new circumstances
- **Coping with Pressures and Setbacks** focuses on stress resilience and emotional composure

An individual might handle pressure well but resist change, or embrace change readily but struggle under sustained stress.

#### Under Factor 8: Enterprising and Performing

**8.1 Achieving Personal Work Goals and Objectives**
- **Definition**: Sets ambitious goals, shows personal drive and motivation, pursues career advancement, demonstrates commitment to self-development.
- **Key OPQ Predictors**: Achieving (positive), Competitive (positive), Vigorous (positive—energy for goal pursuit)
- **Example Behaviors**: Setting stretch goals, pursuing career advancement, demonstrating sustained effort toward objectives, showing personal ambition
- **Role Relevance**: Individual contributor roles, professional services, sales, any role valuing self-motivation

**8.2 Entrepreneurial and Commercial Thinking** *(Note: This dimension appears under both Leading/Deciding and Enterprising/Performing in different UCF documentation versions, reflecting its dual relevance)*
- **Definition**: Shows business acumen, identifies opportunities, demonstrates commercial awareness, takes calculated risks.
- **Key OPQ Predictors**: Achieving (positive), Competitive (positive), Data Rational (moderate—for commercial analysis)

### The Power of Differentiation

The value of Tier 2's 20 dimensions becomes clear when considering how they differentiate related but distinct workplace behaviors that might be confused at the Great Eight level.

**Example 1: Different Types of Leadership**
- "Leading and Deciding" (Tier 1) is too broad for precise selection or development
- Tier 2 differentiates:
  - **Deciding and Initiating Action**: "John makes decisions quickly and takes initiative" (strong for individual contributor leadership)
  - **Leading and Supervising**: "John struggles to direct others' work" (development need for management role)
  - **Entrepreneurial and Commercial Thinking**: "John shows strong business acumen" (strength for commercial role)

**Example 2: Different Types of Communication**
- "Interacting and Presenting" (Tier 1) covers too much ground
- Tier 2 differentiates:
  - **Relating and Networking**: "Sarah builds strong relationships over time" (excellent for account management)
  - **Persuading and Influencing**: "Sarah struggles to change others' opinions" (development need for change management)
  - **Presenting and Communicating Information**: "Sarah delivers clear presentations" (strength for training role)

**Example 3: Different Types of Conscientiousness**
- "Organizing and Executing" (Tier 1) doesn't specify which aspect
- Tier 2 differentiates:
  - **Planning and Organizing**: "Mike plans projects systematically" (strength for project management)
  - **Delivering Results and Meeting Customer Expectations**: "Mike consistently meets deadlines" (strength for operations)
  - **Following Instructions and Procedures**: "Mike sometimes questions established procedures" (potential issue for compliance role, strength for innovative role)

### OPQ Trait Mappings: Building the Algorithm

Each of the 20 dimensions has a proprietary **mapping matrix** that specifies:

1. **Which of the 32 OPQ traits serve as positive predictors** (high scores increase the competency prediction)
2. **Which traits serve as negative predictors** (high scores decrease the competency prediction)
3. **The relative weighting of each trait** (how much influence each has)
4. **Whether Verify ability scores contribute** (and their weighting if so)

While SHL keeps the precise algorithms proprietary, research publications and technical manuals reveal the general mapping logic:

**Analyzing (Dimension 4.3)**
- *Positive predictors*: Data Rational (+), Evaluative (+), Conceptual (+)
- *Negative predictors*: Behavioral (-)
- *Ability influence*: Numerical Reasoning (strong +), Verbal Reasoning (moderate +)
- *Weighting ratio*: Ability β = 0.226, Personality β = 0.122 (1.85:1 ratio favoring ability)

**Adapting and Responding to Change (Dimension 7.1)**
- *Positive predictors*: Adaptable (+), Change Oriented (+), Relaxed (+)
- *Negative predictors*: Conventional (-), Worrying (-)
- *Ability influence*: Minimal

**Leading and Supervising (Dimension 1.2)**
- *Positive predictors*: Controlling (+), Outspoken (+), Decisive (+)
- *Negative predictors*: Democratic (slight -), Modest (-)
- *Ability influence*: Minimal

This mapping logic ensures that the competency predictions align with both theoretical expectations (traits that should logically predict behaviors) and empirical data (traits that actually do predict performance ratings).

### Multi-Assessment Integration at Tier 2

Tier 2 is where the UCF's multi-assessment integration achieves its fullest expression. For several dimensions, combining personality (OPQ) and ability (Verify) data significantly increases predictive validity:

**Analyzing and Interpreting Domain**:
- Personality-only validity: ρ ≈ 0.16-0.20
- Combined (P+A) validity: ρ = 0.44
- Improvement: +120% to +175%

**Interacting and Presenting Domain**:
- Personality-only validity: ρ ≈ 0.24
- Combined (P+A) validity: ρ = 0.40
- Improvement: +67%

**Creating and Conceptualizing Domain**:
- Personality-only validity: ρ ≈ 0.22
- Combined (P+A) validity: ρ = 0.36
- Improvement: +64%

**Organizing and Executing Domain**:
- Personality-only validity: ρ ≈ 0.26
- Combined (P+A) validity: ρ = 0.35
- Improvement: +35%

These dramatic validity improvements justify the complexity and cost of multi-assessment administration, demonstrating that competencies requiring both preference (personality) and power (ability) are best predicted by measuring both.

### Tier 2 in Report Generation

In a typical Universal Competency Report:

1. **Section Organization**: After an overview, the report presents sections for each Great Eight factor
2. **Dimension Detail**: Within each factor section, the relevant Tier 2 dimensions are presented with:
   - **Competency Potential Score**: Often a 1-10 scale or percentile showing predicted potential
   - **Graphical Display**: Bar chart or similar visualization
   - **Narrative Explanation**: Text describing which OPQ traits (and ability scores, if included) contributed to the prediction
   - **Positive Factors**: "Likely strengths that support this competency..."
   - **Limiting Factors**: "Characteristics that may constrain performance in this area..."

3. **Comparative Profile**: A summary chart shows all 20 dimensions on a single page for quick visual comparison

4. **Development Priorities**: The report may flag dimensions where competency potential is particularly high or low relative to role requirements

### Balancing Specificity and Usability

Twenty dimensions represents a careful balance:

**Enough Specificity**: Differentiate between related behaviors, enable targeted development, allow role-specific customization

**Not Too Many**: Avoid overwhelming users, maintain comprehensibility, ensure each dimension is meaningfully distinct

Research on the UCF considered whether additional dimensions would improve the framework. Factor analysis suggested that going beyond 20 dimensions:
- Produces unstable factors that don't replicate across samples
- Creates excessive overlap between dimensions
- Overwhelms end-users with too much detail
- Doesn't significantly improve predictive validity

Conversely, reducing below 20 dimensions (say, to 12 or 15) loses important differentiations that matter for real-world talent decisions.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Standard Operating Level**: The 20 dimensions represent the optimal balance of specificity and comprehensiveness for most assessment purposes.

2. **Hierarchical Organization**: All 20 dimensions cluster logically under the eight Great Eight factors, maintaining conceptual coherence.

3. **Meaningful Differentiation**: The 20 dimensions distinguish related but distinct workplace behaviors—for example, separating "Deciding and Initiating" from "Leading and Supervising" from "Entrepreneurial Thinking."

4. **Convergence Point**: Tier 2 is where personality (OPQ) and ability (Verify) data converge most effectively to produce Competency Potential Scores.

5. **Proprietary Mapping**: Each dimension has a specific algorithm defining which OPQ traits (and ability scores) predict it, with specific weightings.

6. **Multi-Assessment Value**: Several dimensions show dramatic validity improvements when personality and ability are combined, justifying integrated assessment.

7. **Report Organization**: In practice, reports present the 20 dimensions grouped under Great Eight headings, with scores, narratives, and developmental guidance for each.

8. **Practical Balance**: Twenty dimensions is enough to be specific and actionable but not so many as to overwhelm decision-makers or lose conceptual clarity.

9. **Role Customization**: Organizations can emphasize different dimensions for different roles while maintaining a common competency language.

10. **OPQ Trait Examples**: Specific mappings include Data Rational/Evaluative/Conceptual → Analyzing; Controlling/Outspoken → Leading and Supervising; Relaxed/Optimistic → Coping with Pressure.
