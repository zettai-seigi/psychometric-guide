---

## Stopping Rules

[Content to be added: Standard error thresholds, minimum/maximum items, termination criteria]

---

## Item Banking

[Content to be added: Requirements for CAT item pools, calibration, content balancing]

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Adaptive Algorithm:** CAT selects each item in real-time based on current ability estimate
2. **Maximum Information:** Items chosen to provide most measurement precision at current theta
3. **50% Efficiency Gain:** CAT achieves same reliability as fixed-form tests with half the items
4. **Enhanced Security:** Each candidate receives unique item sequence, reducing cheating risk
5. **Stopping Rules:** Tests terminate when standard error reaches acceptable threshold
6. **Item Banking:** Requires large calibrated item pools with documented parameters
7. **Exposure Control:** Mechanisms prevent overuse of high-information items
