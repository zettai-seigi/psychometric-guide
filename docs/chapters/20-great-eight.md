# Chapter 20: Tier 1 - The Great Eight

## Introduction

The Universal Competency Framework's three-tier architecture begins with the Great Eight—a parsimonious set of eight broad competency factors that capture the essential dimensions of workplace performance. This top-level taxonomy serves multiple purposes: providing executive-level overviews of candidate potential, enabling cross-role comparisons, and offering a memorable structure for organizational competency discussions. Understanding Tier 1 reveals how SHL balances comprehensiveness with usability, creating a framework that accommodates both high-level strategic decisions and detailed behavioral analysis.

The Great Eight represent decades of factor-analytic research synthesizing hundreds of organizational competency models. Rather than imposing a theoretical structure, Professor Dave Bartram's research identified empirical clusters in how organizations actually define and evaluate performance. The resulting eight factors—Leading and Deciding, Supporting and Cooperating, Interacting and Presenting, Analyzing and Interpreting, Creating and Conceptualizing, Organizing and Executing, Adapting and Coping, and Enterprising and Performing—reflect common language across industries, cultures, and organizational contexts. This empirical grounding ensures the framework resonates with practitioners while maintaining scientific rigor.

The strategic value of Tier 1 lies in its executive accessibility. While complete 20-dimension profiles provide rich detail, busy executives require digestible summaries. The Great Eight enable rapid talent review conversations where leaders can quickly grasp candidate strengths across major performance domains without drowning in detail. This chapter explores each factor's composition, the research validating the eight-factor structure, and practical applications in talent review and succession planning contexts.

## The Highest Level: Strategic Simplicity

The Great Eight competency factors represent Tier 1 of the UCF hierarchy—the highest level of abstraction in SHL's competency architecture. These eight factors serve multiple strategic functions:

**Executive Summary Level**: Provide a high-level overview of candidate strengths suitable for senior decision-makers who need quick insights.

**Organizational Categories**: Serve as thematic headings under which the more specific 20 dimensions are grouped in reports.

**Universal Language**: Offer a common vocabulary for discussing performance that applies across all roles, industries, and cultures.

**Conceptual Anchors**: Ground the more granular lower tiers in broader, research-validated performance domains.

The Great Eight are deliberately framed in **active voice** and **corporate utility terms**—not as abstract psychological traits, but as action-oriented capabilities. This framing reflects the UCF's criterion-centric philosophy: the focus is on what people do at work, not on their internal psychological states.

## Factor 1: Leading and Deciding

**Definition**: Takes control, initiates action, gives directions, makes decisions, exercises authority, manages resources, and takes responsibility.

**Core Behavioral Manifestations**:
- Taking charge in situations of ambiguity or crisis
- Making decisions without needing consensus or extensive consultation
- Initiating projects and actions rather than waiting for direction
- Exercising authority and control over situations and people
- Allocating resources and setting priorities
- Taking ownership of outcomes and accepting accountability

**Psychological Predictors**:

*Primary Personality Predictors:*
- **Need for Power/Dominance**: The fundamental drive to influence, control, and lead others
- **Extraversion**: Assertiveness and social boldness that facilitate taking charge
- **Controlling** (OPQ trait): Preference for directing others and taking leadership roles
- **Outspoken** (OPQ trait): Comfort expressing opinions and challenging others
- **Independent Minded** (OPQ trait): Confidence in own judgments and willingness to act autonomously
- **Decisive** (OPQ trait): Tendency to make quick decisions without prolonged deliberation

*Cognitive Predictors:*
While personality dominates the prediction of Leading and Deciding, general mental ability (GMA) plays a moderating role, particularly in complex leadership contexts where strategic thinking and problem-solving are required.

**Role in Reports**: In Universal Competency Reports, Leading and Deciding serves as the first major section heading, under which more specific dimensions like "Deciding and Initiating Action" and "Leading and Supervising" are detailed. A candidate with high scores on Controlling, Outspoken, and Decisive will typically show elevated competency potential in this domain.

**Developmental Implications**: This competency is critical for leadership roles, project management, and any position requiring initiative and decision-making authority. Low scores may indicate preference for collaborative environments with shared authority, while high scores suggest suitability for directive leadership roles.

**Cultural Considerations**: The emphasis on individual decision-making and directive leadership reflects Western organizational norms. In collectivist cultures, Leading and Deciding may manifest more as "consensus-building" and "coordinating group efforts," though the underlying competency remains relevant.

## Factor 2: Supporting and Cooperating

**Definition**: Shows concern for others, works cooperatively as part of a team, demonstrates consideration and empathy, supports colleagues, and helps others succeed.

**Core Behavioral Manifestations**:
- Demonstrating genuine concern for others' wellbeing and feelings
- Working effectively as a team member rather than competing
- Providing support and assistance to colleagues proactively
- Showing consideration and tact in interactions
- Building positive relationships based on mutual support
- Putting team goals ahead of personal recognition

**Psychological Predictors**:

*Primary Personality Predictor:*
- **Agreeableness**: The fundamental dimension of interpersonal warmth, cooperation, and concern for others

*Specific OPQ Traits:*
- **Caring** (OPQ trait): Concern for others' feelings and needs
- **Democratic** (OPQ trait): Preference for consulting others and seeking input
- **Modest** (OPQ trait): Lack of self-promotion and willingness to credit others
- **Affiliative** (OPQ trait): Need for social connection and warm relationships
- **Socially Confident** (negative predictor when extreme): Very high social boldness can reduce sensitivity to others' feelings

**Role in Reports**: Supporting and Cooperating appears as a major competency domain particularly relevant for team-based roles, customer service, and collaborative environments. It represents the counterbalance to Leading and Deciding—while that factor emphasizes assertion and control, this factor emphasizes harmony and cooperation.

**Developmental Implications**: Critical for roles requiring teamwork, customer interaction, and supportive functions. High scores indicate natural team players who build positive relationships; low scores may suggest preference for independent work or competitive environments.

**The Agreeableness Trade-off**: Industrial psychology research reveals an interesting paradox: while Agreeableness predicts team effectiveness and relationship quality, it sometimes negatively correlates with career advancement and salary. This occurs because highly agreeable individuals may be less aggressive in self-promotion, salary negotiation, and competitive contexts. The UCF framework helps organizations recognize this trade-off: Supporting and Cooperating is essential for organizational culture and team performance, even if it doesn't directly predict individual advancement.

## Factor 3: Interacting and Presenting

**Definition**: Communicates effectively, makes persuasive presentations, networks, projects credibility, influences others, and represents the organization externally.

**Core Behavioral Manifestations**:
- Presenting information clearly and persuasively to groups
- Networking and building external relationships
- Representing the organization professionally to stakeholders
- Influencing others through communication
- Projecting confidence and credibility in interactions
- Adapting communication style to different audiences

**Psychological Predictors**:

*Primary Personality Predictor:*
- **Extraversion**: The foundational trait enabling social engagement, communication fluency, and comfort with public attention

*Specific OPQ Traits:*
- **Persuasive** (OPQ trait): Actively influencing others' opinions and decisions
- **Socially Confident** (OPQ trait): Comfort in social situations and public speaking
- **Forward Thinking** (OPQ trait): Discussing ideas and future possibilities
- **Articulate** (OPQ trait): Expressing ideas clearly and fluently

*Cognitive Predictor:*
- **General Mental Ability (GMA)**: Particularly verbal reasoning, which supports clarity of expression, argument construction, and adaptation of message complexity to audience

**The Personality-Ability Synergy**: Interacting and Presenting exemplifies the value of multi-assessment integration. Personality (Extraversion) provides the *preference* and comfort with communication, while ability (Verbal Reasoning) provides the *power* to communicate effectively. The UCF's competency scoring algorithm recognizes this:
- High Extraversion + High Verbal Ability = Very High competency potential
- High Extraversion + Low Verbal Ability = Moderate potential (confident but may struggle with complex communication)
- Low Extraversion + High Verbal Ability = Moderate potential (capable but may avoid communication opportunities)
- Low Extraversion + Low Verbal Ability = Low potential

**Role in Reports**: This competency features prominently in profiles for sales, marketing, public relations, client-facing roles, and leadership positions requiring stakeholder communication.

**Developmental Implications**: Moderately trainable—communication skills workshops can improve technique, but fundamental comfort with social interaction and public speaking is more trait-based. Development should focus on leveraging existing strengths rather than forcing introverts into highly extraverted roles.

## Factor 4: Analyzing and Interpreting

**Definition**: Processes and analyzes complex information, applies technical or professional expertise, identifies problems and solutions, and demonstrates analytical thinking.

**Core Behavioral Manifestations**:
- Analyzing data and information systematically
- Identifying underlying patterns and root causes
- Applying technical or professional knowledge to problems
- Evaluating information critically before reaching conclusions
- Working with numerical, verbal, or abstract information
- Making evidence-based rather than intuitive decisions

**Psychological Predictors**:

*Primary Cognitive Predictor:*
- **General Mental Ability (GMA)**: The dominant predictor, particularly Numerical Reasoning and Verbal Reasoning

*Primary Personality Predictor:*
- **Openness to Experience**: Intellectual curiosity and preference for complex, abstract thinking

*Specific OPQ Traits:*
- **Data Rational** (OPQ trait): Preference for basing decisions on facts and data
- **Evaluative** (OPQ trait): Critically analyzing information rather than accepting it uncritically
- **Conceptual** (OPQ trait): Comfort with abstract ideas and theoretical thinking
- **Behavioral** (negative predictor): Preference for focusing on people's behavior rather than data

**The Strongest Ability Influence**: Research on the UCF's predictive validity reveals that Analyzing and Interpreting shows the strongest influence of cognitive ability among all Great Eight factors. Empirical regression weights demonstrate that for this competency:
- Ability (β = 0.226) outweighs Personality (β = 0.122) by a ratio of 1.85:1

This makes intuitive sense: while personality may influence whether someone enjoys analytical work, actual analytical competence fundamentally depends on cognitive capacity.

**The DNV Logic Application**: Analyzing and Interpreting is the primary domain where the UCF's DNV (Diagrammatic, Numerical, Verbal) Logic—also called the Penalty Function—operates. If a candidate scores high on Data Rational (personality preference for analysis) but low on Numerical Reasoning (cognitive capacity), the algorithm applies a penalty to the overall competency prediction and generates a specific narrative: "While likely to value data-driven decision making, may struggle with complex quantitative analysis."

**Role in Reports**: Central to profiles for analytical roles, professional positions (legal, financial, scientific), technical functions, and strategic planning positions.

**Developmental Implications**: Cognitive abilities are largely fixed in adulthood, so development focuses on building specific analytical techniques, domain knowledge, and decision-making frameworks rather than enhancing underlying mental capacity.

## Factor 5: Creating and Conceptualizing

**Definition**: Demonstrates innovation, generates new ideas, embraces change, thinks strategically about the future, and challenges conventional approaches.

**Core Behavioral Manifestations**:
- Generating novel ideas and creative solutions
- Thinking strategically about future possibilities
- Challenging existing methods and assumptions
- Embracing organizational change and innovation
- Seeing connections between disparate concepts
- Demonstrating intellectual flexibility and adaptability

**Psychological Predictors**:

*Primary Personality Predictor:*
- **Openness to Experience**: The fundamental dimension of intellectual curiosity, creativity, and preference for novelty

*Specific OPQ Traits:*
- **Innovative** (OPQ trait): Generating new ideas and approaches
- **Forward Thinking** (OPQ trait): Focus on future possibilities rather than present details
- **Change Oriented** (OPQ trait): Embracing rather than resisting change
- **Conceptual** (OPQ trait): Comfort with abstract, theoretical thinking
- **Conventional** (negative predictor): Preference for traditional, established methods

*Cognitive Predictor:*
- **General Mental Ability (GMA)**: Particularly important for strategic thinking and connecting complex ideas, though less central than for Analyzing and Interpreting

**The Innovation-Implementation Tension**: Creating and Conceptualizing often exists in creative tension with Organizing and Executing. Highly innovative individuals (high Openness, low Conscientiousness) may generate brilliant ideas but struggle with implementation. Highly organized individuals (low Openness, high Conscientiousness) excel at execution but may resist new approaches. The UCF framework helps organizations recognize this trade-off and build balanced teams or develop individuals' complementary skills.

**Role in Reports**: Critical for strategy roles, R&D positions, marketing, organizational development, and leadership roles requiring vision and change management.

**Developmental Implications**: Openness to Experience is relatively stable in adulthood, but creative thinking techniques, exposure to diverse ideas, and permission to challenge conventional wisdom can enhance this competency's expression.

## Factor 6: Organizing and Executing

**Definition**: Plans and organizes work systematically, delivers results on time and to specification, manages details, follows through on commitments, and ensures quality.

**Core Behavioral Manifestations**:
- Planning work systematically with clear steps and timelines
- Organizing information, resources, and activities efficiently
- Following through on commitments and meeting deadlines
- Attending to details and ensuring accuracy
- Delivering quality work that meets specifications
- Managing multiple priorities and workload effectively

**Psychological Predictors**:

*Primary Personality Predictor:*
- **Conscientiousness**: The fundamental dimension of organization, responsibility, and achievement striving

*Specific OPQ Traits:*
- **Detail Conscious** (OPQ trait): Attention to accuracy and specifics
- **Conscientious** (OPQ trait): Following rules and completing tasks thoroughly
- **Forward Planning** (OPQ trait): Thinking ahead and organizing in advance
- **Achieving** (OPQ trait): Setting high standards and striving to meet them
- **Adaptable** (negative predictor when extreme): Very high flexibility may reduce systematic planning

*Cognitive Predictor:*
- **General Mental Ability (GMA)**: Supports complex planning, prioritization, and project management in sophisticated roles

**The Universal Performance Predictor**: Research consistently demonstrates that Conscientiousness predicts job performance across virtually all occupations, making Organizing and Executing one of the most broadly relevant competencies. Its validity remains robust even in creative roles where Conscientiousness might seem less critical—even innovative work requires follow-through and delivery.

**Role in Reports**: Organizing and Executing features in nearly all competency profiles, though its relative importance varies. It's particularly critical for project management, operations, administrative roles, and any position where reliability and detail orientation are essential.

**Developmental Implications**: Moderately trainable through time management systems, organizational tools, and accountability structures, though fundamental Conscientiousness is relatively stable. Development focuses on building systems and habits that support organized behavior.

## Factor 7: Adapting and Coping

**Definition**: Maintains emotional stability under pressure, adapts positively to change and setbacks, handles criticism constructively, and manages stress effectively.

**Core Behavioral Manifestations**:
- Remaining calm and composed under pressure
- Adapting positively when circumstances change
- Recovering quickly from setbacks and disappointments
- Handling criticism without becoming defensive or demoralized
- Managing stress effectively without burnout
- Maintaining consistent performance in challenging conditions

**Psychological Predictors**:

*Primary Personality Predictor:*
- **Emotional Stability** (opposite of Neuroticism): The fundamental dimension of emotional resilience and stress tolerance

*Specific OPQ Traits:*
- **Relaxed** (OPQ trait): Remaining calm under pressure
- **Tough Minded** (OPQ trait): Not being overly affected by criticism
- **Optimistic** (OPQ trait): Maintaining positive outlook during difficulties
- **Worrying** (negative predictor): Tendency to become anxious about problems
- **Emotionally Controlled** (OPQ trait): Managing emotional reactions appropriately

*Cognitive Predictor:*
Unlike most Great Eight factors, Adapting and Coping has minimal cognitive component—it is almost purely a function of personality, specifically Emotional Stability.

**The Selection-Development Dilemma**: Emotional Stability presents a particular challenge because:
1. It's one of the strongest predictors of overall job performance and career success
2. It's highly stable across adulthood—among the least changeable personality traits
3. Traditional training programs have limited impact on fundamental stress reactivity

This combination makes Adapting and Coping critical for selection decisions but challenging for development interventions. The most effective "development" often involves environmental modification (reducing stressors, providing support) rather than trying to change the individual.

**Role in Reports**: Particularly emphasized in profiles for high-stress roles (emergency services, healthcare, financial trading), customer-facing positions (handling difficult clients), and leadership roles (managing organizational pressure).

**The Modern Imperative**: In contemporary work environments characterized by constant change, ambiguity, and pressure, Adapting and Coping has become increasingly critical across all roles. The COVID-19 pandemic, rapid technological change, and economic volatility have elevated this competency's importance.

## Factor 8: Enterprising and Performing

**Definition**: Focuses on results and achievement, seizes business opportunities, demonstrates commercial awareness, drives for success, and shows career ambition.

**Core Behavioral Manifestations**:
- Driving for results and measurable achievements
- Identifying and seizing business opportunities
- Demonstrating commercial and financial awareness
- Showing competitive drive to succeed
- Pursuing career advancement and professional growth
- Taking calculated risks to achieve objectives

**Psychological Predictors**:

*Primary Personality Predictor:*
- **Need for Achievement**: The fundamental motivational drive to succeed, excel, and accomplish challenging goals

*Specific OPQ Traits:*
- **Achieving** (OPQ trait): Setting ambitious goals and striving to meet them
- **Competitive** (OPQ trait): Desire to win and outperform others
- **Vigorous** (OPQ trait): High energy and activity level
- **Decisive** (OPQ trait): Making decisions quickly to capitalize on opportunities
- **Commercial** (OPQ trait): Focus on profit, costs, and business value

*Cognitive Predictor:*
- **General Mental Ability (GMA)**: Moderate influence, particularly for strategic commercial thinking and complex business analysis

**The Motivation Connection**: Enterprising and Performing shows the strongest connection to SHL's Motivation Questionnaire (MQ). While personality and ability predict whether someone *can* perform this competency, motivation determines whether they *will*. Key MQ dimensions that align with this factor include:
- **Interest in Career & Position Advancement**
- **Interest in Financial Rewards**
- **Interest in Personal Growth**
- **Interest in Competition**

**The Double-Edged Sword**: High Enterprising and Performing can predict both exceptional performance and problematic behavior. The same achievement drive that fuels success can also manifest as:
- Excessive risk-taking
- Unethical shortcuts to achieve results
- Burnout from overwork
- Damaged relationships due to competitive behavior

This is why the UCF framework emphasizes assessing multiple competencies in combination—high Enterprising and Performing is most valuable when balanced with high Supporting and Cooperating (ethical relationships) and adequate Adapting and Coping (stress management).

**Role in Reports**: Central to profiles for sales, business development, leadership, entrepreneurial roles, and any position where driving results and commercial success are paramount.

## Alignment with the Big Five: Construct Validation

One of the UCF's most compelling features is its elegant alignment with the Big Five personality model, providing powerful construct validation:

![Figure 20.1: The Great Eight competency factors arranged in octagonal format](/psychometric-guide/images/Figure_20_01.png)

*Figure 20.1: The Great Eight competency factors arranged in octagonal format, showing alignment with Big Five personality factors and General Mental Ability (GMA)*

| **Great Eight Factor** | **Primary Big Five Alignment** | **Supporting Constructs** |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Leading and Deciding | Extraversion (Assertiveness) | Need for Power |
| Supporting and Cooperating | Agreeableness | Empathy |
| Interacting and Presenting | Extraversion (Sociability) | Verbal Ability (GMA) |
| Analyzing and Interpreting | Openness to Experience | General Mental Ability (GMA) |
| Creating and Conceptualizing | Openness to Experience | General Mental Ability (GMA) |
| Organizing and Executing | Conscientiousness | General Mental Ability (GMA) |
| Adapting and Coping | Emotional Stability | -- |
| Enterprising and Performing | Conscientiousness (Achievement Striving) | Need for Achievement |

This alignment demonstrates that the UCF isn't inventing new psychological constructs—it's reframing established personality and ability dimensions in terms of their workplace manifestations. This provides multiple advantages:

**Theoretical Grounding**: The Great Eight inherit decades of personality research validating the Big Five's stability, universality, and predictive validity.

**Cross-Instrument Comparison**: Because the Big Five framework is universal, UCF-based reports can be conceptually compared with results from other instruments (Hogan HPI, NEO-PI-R, etc.), even though the specific mappings differ.

**Training Efficiency**: Psychologists trained in Big Five theory can quickly understand the UCF's structure and interpretation.

**Cultural Validity**: The Big Five appear consistently across cultures, suggesting the Great Eight should also exhibit cross-cultural validity (which validation research has confirmed).

## The Corporate Framing: From Traits to Actions

Notice that the Great Eight are framed as action verbs and workplace behaviors rather than psychological traits:

- Not "High Conscientiousness" but "**Organizing and Executing**"
- Not "Emotional Stability" but "**Adapting and Coping**"
- Not "Extraversion" but "**Leading and Deciding**" and "**Interacting and Presenting**"

This reframing reflects the UCF's criterion-centric philosophy. Business users don't care about abstract personality constructs—they care about what people actually do at work. By describing competencies in active, behavioral terms, the UCF makes assessment results immediately relevant to hiring, development, and succession planning decisions.

## Factor-Analytic Evidence: Why Eight?

Why eight factors rather than five, ten, or twenty? The answer comes from factor-analytic research on competency rating data.

When Bartram and colleagues factor-analyzed supervisory ratings of employee competencies across multiple organizations and roles, eight factors consistently emerged. Attempts to extract fewer factors (e.g., five, matching the Big Five) resulted in loss of meaningful distinctions. Attempts to extract more factors (e.g., twelve or sixteen) produced unstable factors that didn't replicate across samples.

Eight factors represent the optimal balance between:
- **Parsimony**: Few enough to be cognitively manageable and provide useful high-level summaries
- **Differentiation**: Enough to capture meaningfully distinct performance domains
- **Stability**: Replicable across different organizations, roles, and cultures
- **Predictability**: Each factor shows distinct patterns of personality and ability predictors

## Using the Great Eight in Practice

In Universal Competency Reports, the Great Eight serve as structural organizing categories:

1. **Report Sections**: Each Great Eight factor gets its own major section with an overview of the candidate's potential in that domain.

2. **Dimension Grouping**: Under each factor heading, the relevant Tier 2 dimensions (20 competency dimensions) are presented with detailed scoring and narrative.

3. **Visual Summary**: Many reports include a "Great Eight Profile"—a spider diagram or bar chart showing relative strengths across all eight factors for quick visual comparison.

4. **Development Planning**: The Great Eight provide useful categories for identifying development priorities—"This candidate should focus on enhancing Adapting and Coping and Organizing and Executing."

5. **Team Composition**: Organizations can analyze team profiles to identify collective strengths and gaps across the Great Eight factors.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Strategic Level**: The Great Eight represent Tier 1 of the UCF—the highest level of abstraction, serving as executive summaries and organizational categories.

2. **Active Framing**: Each factor is framed in active, behavioral terms (e.g., "Leading and Deciding") rather than psychological constructs (e.g., "Dominance"), reflecting the criterion-centric philosophy.

3. **Empirical Foundation**: The eight-factor structure emerged from factor analysis of competency ratings, representing the optimal balance of parsimony and differentiation.

4. **Psychological Predictors**: Each factor aligns with specific personality traits and cognitive abilities:
   - Leading and Deciding: Need for Power, Extraversion
   - Supporting and Cooperating: Agreeableness
   - Interacting and Presenting: Extraversion, Verbal Ability
   - Analyzing and Interpreting: GMA, Openness
   - Creating and Conceptualizing: Openness, GMA
   - Organizing and Executing: Conscientiousness, GMA
   - Adapting and Coping: Emotional Stability
   - Enterprising and Performing: Need for Achievement, Conscientiousness

5. **Big Five Alignment**: The Great Eight map elegantly onto the Big Five personality model, providing construct validation and theoretical grounding.

6. **Multi-Assessment Integration**: Several factors (Interacting and Presenting, Analyzing and Interpreting) demonstrate the value of combining personality and ability data for optimal prediction.

7. **Universal Relevance**: While their relative importance varies by role, all eight factors apply across jobs, industries, and cultures, enabling universal competency language.

8. **Report Organization**: In practice, the Great Eight serve as structural headings under which more specific competencies are organized and discussed.
