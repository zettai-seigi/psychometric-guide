- General Mental Ability (g factor) and its workplace relevance
- The three cognitive domains: Numerical, Verbal, and Inductive Reasoning
- Verify G+ Combined Test structure
- Domain-specific tests
- Theoretical foundations (Carroll's three-stratum theory, Spearman's g)
- Workplace applications and validity evidence
