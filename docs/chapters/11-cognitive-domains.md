## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. Explain Carroll's three-stratum theory of cognitive abilities
2. Describe the hierarchical structure of intelligence
3. Understand the g factor's role as general mental ability
4. Identify how specific abilities relate to general ability
5. Explain why GMA predicts job performance
6. Describe the three Verify domains in detail

## Hierarchical Models of Intelligence

**Note:** Detailed content for this chapter should be sourced from comprehensive SHL documentation. This chapter covers:

- Carroll's three-stratum theory
- The g factor at the apex
- Broad abilities (Stratum II)
- Narrow abilities (Stratum III)
- Spearman's original g theory
- Modern confirmatory factor analysis evidence

## The g Factor: General Mental Ability

[Content to be added: Deep dive into GMA, its measurement, and workplace relevance]

---

## Numerical Reasoning Domain

[Content to be added: Detailed coverage of numerical reasoning, sample items, cognitive processes]

---

## Verbal Reasoning Domain

[Content to be added: Detailed coverage of verbal reasoning, sample items, cognitive processes]

---

## Inductive/Diagrammatic Reasoning Domain

[Content to be added: Detailed coverage of inductive reasoning, pattern recognition, abstract reasoning]

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Hierarchical Structure:** Intelligence is best understood as hierarchical with g at the apex
2. **g Factor Dominance:** GMA accounts for substantial variance in job performance
3. **Domain Specificity:** While g is general, domain-specific abilities add incremental validity
4. **Verify Alignment:** Verify's three domains map onto established cognitive ability theory
5. **Practical Implications:** Understanding cognitive structure informs test selection and interpretation
