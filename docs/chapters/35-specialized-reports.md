## 35.1 OPQ32 Profile Chart: Visual Trait Display

![Figure 35.1: Overview of specialized report types](/psychometric-guide/images/Figure_35_01.png)

*Figure 35.1: Overview of specialized report types showing how the same assessment data is formatted differently for assessment specialists (Profile Chart), hiring managers (Manager Plus), candidates (Participant Report), development programs (360 Report), and succession planning (HiPo Report)*

**Purpose and Audience:**

The OPQ Profile Chart provides a "trait snapshot" of a candidate's personality dimensions, serving as the technical, quantitative foundation for personality assessment. This report is designed primarily for assessment specialists and trained psychometric practitioners who require detailed psychometric data.

**Structure and Format:**

**Graphical Display:**
The Profile Chart presents all 32 OPQ traits on a single page, typically using:

1. **Horizontal bar charts:** Each trait displayed as a bar extending from low (left) to high (right)
2. **Sten scale (1-10):** Standard ten-point scale for each trait
3. **Percentile indicators:** May include percentile markers (10th, 50th, 90th percentiles)
4. **Norm reference line:** Typically marks the average (Sten 5.5)

**Trait Organization:**

The 32 traits are organized into three major domains:

**Domain 1: Relationships with People (14 traits)**
- Persuasive, Controlling, Outspoken, Independent, Outgoing, Affiliative, Socially Confident, Modest, Democratic, Caring

**Domain 2: Thinking Style (11 traits)**
- Data Rational, Evaluative, Behavioral, Conventional, Conceptual, Innovative, Variety Seeking, Adaptable, Forward Thinking, Detail Conscious, Conscientious

**Domain 3: Feelings and Emotions (7 traits)**
- Relaxed, Worrying, Tough Minded, Optimistic, Trusting, Emotionally Controlled, Vigorous, Competitive, Achieving, Decisive

**Example Profile Chart Representation:**

```
RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE               Sten Score
Persuasive          [████████░░] 8
Controlling         [███████░░░] 7
Outspoken           [██████░░░░] 6
Independent         [████████░░] 8
Outgoing            [████░░░░░░] 4
Affiliative         [███░░░░░░░] 3
...

THINKING STYLE
Data Rational       [████████░░] 8
Evaluative          [███████░░░] 7
Behavioral          [█████░░░░░] 5
...

FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS
Relaxed             [██░░░░░░░░] 2
Worrying            [████████░░] 8
...
```

**Use Cases:**

1. **Psychometric Validation:** Allows specialists to verify score patterns and identify response styles
2. **In-Depth Analysis:** Enables detailed examination of trait configurations
3. **Research Applications:** Provides raw data for criterion validation studies
4. **Quality Control:** Identifies potential invalid response patterns (e.g., extreme responding, acquiescence)

**Differentiation from Manager Plus Report:**

The Profile Chart is the quantitative, technical data snapshot, while narrative reports (like Manager Plus) provide qualitative, interpretive narratives. The Profile Chart answers "What are the scores?" while narrative reports answer "What do the scores mean?"

## 35.2 Manager Plus Report: Leadership-Focused Narrative

**Purpose and Design:**

The Manager Plus Report is an interpretive output designed for non-specialists, such as HR professionals and line managers, who require results in practical, business-relevant language. It translates the OPQ Profile Chart's quantitative data into actionable insights.

**Key Features:**

**1. Narrative-Driven Format:**

Rather than presenting numerical scores, the report uses prose descriptions:

*Example Trait Interpretation:*
"John is comfortable taking control and making decisions independently. He is confident in expressing his views and may be perceived as direct or assertive. He prefers to work independently rather than in close collaboration with others. While this independence can be valuable in leadership roles, he may need to consciously build collaborative relationships with team members."

**2. Competency Implications:**

The report explicitly links personality traits to leadership and management competencies:

*Example:*
**Decision Making:**
"Likely to make decisions promptly and confidently. May prefer to gather essential information quickly rather than engage in extensive analysis. Could benefit from deliberately seeking input from others before finalizing important decisions."

**3. Management Style Predictions:**

Provides insights into likely management approaches:

*Example:*
- **Task Delegation:** "Comfortable delegating and holding others accountable"
- **Communication Style:** "Direct and explicit in feedback; may be perceived as blunt"
- **Change Management:** "Likely to drive change decisively but may move faster than team comfort allows"

**4. Strengths and Development Areas:**

Explicitly identifies areas where the individual is likely to excel and areas requiring development:

**Strengths:**
- "Natural leadership presence and willingness to take charge"
- "Confident in high-pressure decision situations"
- "Results-focused and achievement-oriented"

**Development Opportunities:**
- "Building consensus and collaborative decision-making"
- "Patience with ambiguity and gradual change"
- "Active listening and seeking diverse perspectives"

**Score-to-Narrative Translation:**

The narrative is generated by automated expert system logic. Psychologists pre-wrote interpretive text for every possible score range on every trait, and the report software selects the appropriate narrative blocks based on the trait scores.

**Complementary to Profile Chart:**

- **Profile Chart:** Provides the "what" (quantitative scores)
- **Manager Plus Report:** Provides the "so what" (behavioral implications)

Together, they serve both technical specialists and practical end-users.

## 35.3 Participant Report: Development-Focused Feedback

**Purpose:**

The Participant Report (also called Feedback Report or Candidate Report) is designed specifically for candidates themselves, providing developmental insights in a non-evaluative, growth-oriented format.

**Distinctive Features:**

**1. Neutral Language:**

The report avoids evaluative terminology that might be perceived as judgmental:

**Avoided:** "Weakness," "Deficiency," "Poor at"
**Preferred:** "Development opportunity," "Area for growth," "Could enhance by"

**2. Self-Reflection Prompts:**

Includes questions to encourage self-awareness:

*Example:*
"You indicated a preference for working independently. Reflect on situations where collaboration might enhance your effectiveness. How might you leverage team input while maintaining your natural working style?"

**3. Development Suggestions:**

Provides specific, actionable development recommendations:

*Example for Low Adaptability:*
- "Practice small changes to routine to build flexibility"
- "Seek projects that require adjusting to new information"
- "Identify areas where structured planning could be complemented by responsive adaptation"

**4. Strengths-Based Framing:**

Emphasizes leveraging strengths while developing new capabilities:

*Example:*
"Your natural analytical orientation is a significant strength. To enhance effectiveness in ambiguous situations, consider how your analytical skills can be applied to scenario planning and contingency thinking."

**5. Normalized Trait Descriptions:**

Explains that traits represent preferences, not fixed capabilities:

*Example:*
"Your profile indicates a preference for detail-oriented work. This doesn't mean you cannot think strategically—rather, you may naturally gravitate toward ensuring details are correct. Understanding this preference allows you to consciously shift focus when strategic thinking is required."

**Use Cases:**

1. **Post-Assessment Feedback:** Providing candidates with results after selection processes
2. **Development Programs:** Foundation for individual development planning
3. **Coaching:** Support material for executive coaching engagements
4. **Self-Awareness Building:** Tool for leadership development programs

**Ethical Considerations:**

The Participant Report adheres to professional guidelines requiring that assessment feedback:
- Is understandable to the recipient
- Avoids stigmatizing language
- Provides actionable insights
- Respects the individual's dignity

## 35.4 360-Degree Integration: Multi-Rater Data Synthesis

**Conceptual Foundation:**

The 360 Participant Report synthesizes an individual's behavioral preferences (from OPQ) with rater observations from different groups (manager, colleagues, direct reports, self-reflection) to provide a comprehensive performance picture.

**Data Sources:**

**1. Self-Assessment (OPQ32):**
- Personality preferences and typical behavioral style
- Provides the "intended" or preferred approach

**2. Manager Ratings:**
- Supervisor observations of actual workplace behaviors
- Performance in current role context

**3. Peer Ratings:**
- Colleague observations of collaborative behaviors
- Effectiveness in lateral relationships

**4. Direct Report Ratings:**
- Subordinate observations of leadership behaviors
- Management and developmental effectiveness

**5. External Stakeholder Ratings:**
- (When applicable) Client or customer perspectives
- External relationship effectiveness

**Integration Methodology:**

The report uses the SHL online Standard Multi-rater Feedback System and may include use of SHL's proprietary Universal Competency Framework. The integration identifies:

**1. Developed Strengths:**
- Areas where both self-perception (OPQ) and rater observations indicate high effectiveness
- *Example:* High OPQ Controlling + High manager/peer ratings on Leadership = "Developed strength in taking charge"

**2. Hidden Strengths:**
- Areas where raters see strengths that the individual underestimates
- *Example:* Moderate OPQ Affiliative + High peer ratings on Relationship Building = "Natural collaborator who may undervalue this capability"

**3. Development Opportunities:**
- Areas where self-perception exceeds observed effectiveness
- *Example:* High OPQ Persuasive + Low peer ratings on Influencing = "May intend to influence but approach not achieving desired impact"

**4. Blind Spots:**
- Behaviors the individual doesn't recognize but others observe
- *Example:* Low OPQ Worrying + High manager ratings on "Becomes stressed under pressure" = "May not recognize stress impact on performance"

**Graphical Representations:**

360 reports typically include:

1. **Radar Charts:** Showing self vs. rater perceptions across competencies
2. **Gap Analysis Charts:** Highlighting areas of agreement and discrepancy
3. **Frequency Distributions:** Showing range of rater perspectives

**Example:**

```
              Self  Manager  Peers  Direct Reports
Leading        [8]    [7]     [6]       [5]
Collaborating  [6]    [7]     [8]       [8]
Analyzing      [7]    [8]     [7]       [7]
```

**Development Planning Integration:**

The 360 report concludes with prioritized development recommendations based on:
- Greatest gaps between self and others
- Highest importance competencies for role
- Most actionable development areas

## 35.5 HiPo Reports: Ability/Aspiration/Engagement Vectors

**High-Potential Identification Framework:**

SHL's High-Potential (HiPo) reports operationalize research indicating that potential requires three key vectors:

**1. Ability (Can They Do It?):**
- Cognitive capacity (Verify G+ scores)
- Learning agility indicators
- Problem-solving capability

**2. Aspiration (Do They Want To?):**
- Career ambition indicators from OPQ (e.g., Achieving, Competitive)
- Leadership aspiration
- Advancement motivation from MQ

**3. Engagement (Will They Stay?):**
- Organizational commitment indicators
- Cultural fit metrics
- Motivation-role alignment

**Assessment Battery:**

HiPo identification typically combines:

1. **Verify G+ (Cognitive Ability):** Assesses capacity for complex problem-solving
2. **OPQ32 (Personality):** Identifies leadership traits and derailment risks
3. **MQ (Motivation):** Evaluates alignment with leadership roles and organizational culture
4. **Biographical Data:** Career trajectory and demonstrated achievement
5. **Performance Ratings:** Current job performance (predictor of future performance)

**Scoring Methodology:**

**Ability Vector Score:**
- Verify G+ Percentile: Primary indicator
- Learning agility indicators: OPQ traits (Conceptual, Innovative, Adaptable)
- Combined score places candidate in ability quartiles

**Aspiration Vector Score:**
- OPQ traits: Achieving, Competitive, Controlling, Persuasive
- MQ dimensions: Power, Recognition, Advancement
- Combined score indicates leadership aspiration level

**Engagement Vector Score:**
- MQ fit indices: Alignment with organizational values and culture
- OPQ stability indicators: Emotionally Controlled, Relaxed
- Retention risk assessment

**Integration Model:**

```
HiPo Potential Score = w₁(Ability) + w₂(Aspiration) + w₃(Engagement)
```

Typically weighted:
- Ability: 40%
- Aspiration: 30%
- Engagement: 30%

**Classification Matrix:**

**High Ability + High Aspiration + High Engagement = "Ready Now" HiPo**
- Prime candidates for accelerated development
- Succession planning priority

**High Ability + High Aspiration + Low Engagement = "Flight Risk" HiPo**
- High potential but retention concern
- Requires targeted engagement interventions

**High Ability + Low Aspiration + High Engagement = "Solid Citizen"**
- Valuable contributor but not advancement-focused
- May be best in deep expert roles

**Moderate/Low Ability + High Aspiration + High Engagement = "Developmental"**
- Motivated but may lack capability for senior roles
- May benefit from realistic career counseling

**Report Output:**

HiPo reports typically include:

1. **Overall HiPo Classification:** Ready Now, Emerging, Developmental, or Not Ready
2. **Vector Analysis:** Detailed scores on Ability, Aspiration, Engagement
3. **Specific Recommendations:** Development priorities for each vector
4. **Succession Planning Implications:** Recommended timeline and roles
5. **Derailment Risks:** Personality factors that could impede advancement

**Example Narrative:**

*"Sarah demonstrates strong high-potential characteristics. Her cognitive ability (Verify G+ 85th percentile) provides capacity for complex leadership roles. Personality profile shows strong achievement orientation (OPQ Achieving: Sten 8) and confidence in leadership situations (Controlling: Sten 7, Persuasive: Sten 8). Motivation profile indicates strong alignment with advancement opportunities (MQ Power: High, Recognition: High). Primary development focus should be building collaborative decision-making skills (OPQ Democratic: Low) to complement her natural directive style. Recommend accelerated development program with succession planning consideration for senior leadership roles within 3-5 years."*
